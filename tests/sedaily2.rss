<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data-as-a-service businesses offer paid access to data sets. These data sets can be useful for building products or training machine learning models. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There has been steady growth in the tools and practices around processing and storing data. But access to data sets remains a bottleneck for widespread development of machine learning applications in a large set of domains. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SafeGraph is a company focused on the problem of data-as-a-service. Today, SafeGraph’s primary product is reliable, up-to-date location information on places. The data for these points-of-interest needs be acquired, verified, cleaned, made accessible through an API, and intelligently priced. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In previous episodes with SafeGraph, we have explored the basic premise of data businesses and why they are important platforms for building futuristic data products that are impossible for entrepreneurs to build today. SafeGraph CEO Auren Hoffman returns to the show to discuss the data as a service business model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software-as-a-service has existed as a category for more than a decade. Infrastructure-as-a-service has existed for just as long. Data-as-a-service is much more undeveloped. Auren recently published the </span><a href="https://blog.safegraph.com/data-as-a-service-bible-everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-running-daas-companies-d4cf4c15c038"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Data-As-A-Service Bible: Everything You Wanted To Know About Running A DaaS Business”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This was a very useful article, as it breaks down a category of software that is almost entirely unexplored.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large sales organization has hundreds of sales people. Each of those sales people manages a set of accounts who they are trying to close sales deals on. Sales people are overseen by managers who ensure that the sales people are performing well. Directors and VPs ensure the scalability and health of the overall sales organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sales lifecycle mostly takes place within a piece of software called a CRM: customer relationship management. This tool documents the interactions between sales people and accounts. CRMs have been around for many years, and although CRM software is a useful repository of data, it does not fulfill all the needs of a salesperson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People.ai is a system of machine learning tools built around the sales tooling ecosystem. People.ai helps a sales organization avoid manual data entry, understand areas of potential improvement, and decide on who the highest value sales lead to pursue might be. Andrey Akselrod is the CTO At People.ai and he joins the show to discuss the potential applications of machine learning in the domain of sales, and the engineering work that his company has done.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During 2015, Uber was going through rapid scalability. The internal engineering systems were constantly tested by the growing user base. Over the next two years, the number of internal services at Uber would grow from 500 to 2000, and standardizing the monitoring of all these different services became a priority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After working with a variety of available tools, Uber’s engineering team decided that something new needed to be built internally. Jaeger is an open source distributed tracing tool that provides observability features throughout Uber’s microservices architecture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuri Shkuro is an engineer at Uber, where he works on Jaeger and other infrastructure projects. He joins the show to discuss the history of engineering at Uber, the architecture of Jaeger, and the requirements for building and scaling a distributed tracing tool.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A knowledge base assembles information from a wide variety of sources into a central platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most popular knowledge base is Wikipedia, which covers a wide variety of concepts through a system that attempts to remain authoritative and impartial. Other open knowledge platforms include Stack Overflow, which focuses on programming concepts, and Quora, which adds a social element to the process of information accumulation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Golden.com is a knowledge base that indexes, categorizes, and surfaces information. Golden has information about software, genetics, world history, social media, sports, and all kinds of other subjects. The company monetizes with a paid knowledge base product for enterprises, which allows for easy easy querying of the open knowledge base and a private knowledge base for internal information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jude Gomila is the founder of Golden, and joins the show to discuss the process of building a universal knowledge base, and the engineering problems that he is working on to improve Golden.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coding bootcamps allow anyone to become a programmer at a faster pace than the traditional computer science education system. In the last five years, coding bootcamps have grown rapidly in popularity, with thousands of people gaining the necessary skills to work as a software engineer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Career Karma is a platform that allows individuals to find the best coding bootcamp. There are many coding bootcamps, and they are not all the same. Much like different schools have different cultures and focus on different disciplines, coding bootcamps vary widely in their teaching styles and acceptance path.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuben Harris and Artur Meyster are co-founders of Career Karma, and they join the show to discuss the changing nature of software engineering education and the frictions that new programmers encounter as they navigate the world of coding bootcamps. They also describe their journey to entrepreneurship and their own personal experience with coding bootcamps.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hackathon is an organized event where participants work together to build a product or tool. Hackathons are about creativity, learning, and exploration. A developer that is participating in a hackathon is often working on something that is outside of their normal day-to-day focus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hackathons can provide significant value to the participants. Hackathons have led to friendships, new companies, and newly developed confidence that can be critical to a developer who feels uncertain in their ability to launch their own projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan Gottfried is a co-founder of Major League Hacking, an official student hackathon league that powers invention competitions. Major League Hacking is a B corporation that is focused on improving the education and community of technology leaders, entrepreneurs, and young hackers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jon joins the show to discuss hackathons&#8211;and how he has built and scaled an organization that is devoted to creating systematically successful hackathon experiences.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Videos play a key role in the continuing education of a software engineer. Video can capture many different types of content that is useful for engineers: conference talks, tutorial videos, and podcast-style interviews are all popular formats of online video.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube has become the predominant source for video content about software engineering. The open nature of YouTube’s format allows for a tremendous range of content. No matter what your preference is for how you like to learn and be entertained, YouTube has something for you.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://techprimers.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechPrimers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a media channel that is dedicated to sharing technical knowledge in the form of videos, </span><a href="https://github.com/TechPrimers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GitHub repositories</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and a thriving community. </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB12jjYsYv-eipCvBDcMbXw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechPrimers has over 300 videos on YouTube</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and more than 48,000 subscribers who regularly watch content about subjects like AWS, Spring, and Kubernetes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechPrimers was founded by Ajay Kumar. Ajay has been in the software industry for fifteen years, and has been working in enterprise banking systems for seven years. He has deep experience in modern technologies and engineering practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ajay joins the show to discuss the modern world of software engineering, and his experience building a media platform. He also talks about the technology culture of India. Ajay is based in Bengalaru, and it was exciting to learn how much our different societies have in common thanks to technology. </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erU0XUBbGic"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ajay also had me on his YouTube channel for an interview, which was a lot of fun.</span></a></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Internet of Things” is a term used to describe the increasing connectivity and intelligence of physical objects within our lives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IoT has manifested within enterprises under the term “Industrial IoT,” as wireless connectivity and machine learning have started to improve devices such as centrifuges, conveyor belts, and factory robotics. In the consumer space, IoT has moved slower than many people expected, and it remains to be seen when we will have widespread computation within consumer devices such as microwaves, washing machines, and lightswitches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IoT computers have different constraints than general purpose computers. Security, reliability, battery life, power consumption, and cost structures are very different in IoT devices than in your laptop or smartphone. One technology that could solve some of the problems within IoT is WebAssembly, a newer binary instruction format for executable programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan Beri is a software engineer and the organizer of the San Francisco WebAssembly Meetup. He has significant experience in the IoT industry, and joins the show to discuss the state of WebAssembly, the surrounding technologies, and their impact on IoT.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data engineering involves numerous tools&#8211;a data lake, databases, data warehouses, numerous APIs, streaming systems, and microservices. There is no shortage of ways to interact with data and manage data, but many companies are struggling to figure out design patterns and best practices for how to manage data and build data infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zhamak Dehgani is a principal consultant and portfolio director with ThoughtWorks, where she works with enterprises to improve their software systems and workflows. She is the author of an article called </span><a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Move Beyond a Monolithic Data Lake to a Distributed Data Mesh</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and she joins the show to discuss her perspective on data infrastructure, as well as the “data mesh” concept that she has coined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data mesh represents the movement away from having a centralized data lake that all teams interact with, and towards having different data products and individual data management systems for individual domain teams.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software companies such as Slack, Zoom, and Uber have recently gone public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a company goes public, they issue a document called an S-1. Within the S-1, there is a wealth of information about the company, providing a detailed story about the company’s business model, economics, and future prospects. The S-1 describes the operating model and the philosophy of a newly public company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going public serves several purposes. Being public allows a company to gain access to the public capital markets. It allows previous investors to have a liquidity event, by selling the shares that they purchased from the company in private markets. Being public also puts some constraints and visibility on a company, which can be useful for a company that is trying to develop internal discipline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the software industry, it is useful for most people to understand the dynamics of going public. A technology worker who is earning equity at a private company needs to understand the roadmap to their company going public, or potentially getting acquired. Anyone who invests in public technology stocks is evaluating the different available options for investment, and considering the best software companies to place a bet on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tom Tunguz is a venture investor at Redpoint, and the author of a popular blog at </span><a href="https://tomtunguz.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tomasztonguz.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In a recent series of posts, Tom has evaluated the S-1s and compared the growth dynamics between a variety of newer public software companies. Tom joins today’s show to discuss his writing, and offer reflections on what can be learned about company building from the recent series of IPOs and direct listings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy that was originally developed at Lyft. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Envoy is often deployed as a sidecar application that runs alongside a service and helps that service by providing features such as routing, rate limiting, telemetry, and security policy. Envoy has gained significant traction in the open source community, and has formed the backbone of popular service mesh projects such as Istio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Envoy has been mostly used as a backend technology, but the potential applications of Envoy include frontend client applications as well. The goal of Envoy is to make the network easier to work with&#8211;and the network includes client applications such as mobile apps running on a phone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Envoy Mobile is a network proxy for mobile applications. Envoy Mobile brings many of the benefits of Envoy to the mobile client ecosystem. It provides mobile developers with a library that can simplify or abstract away many of the modern advances that have been made in networking in recent years, such as HTTP2, gRPC, and QUIC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matt Klein is the creator of Envoy, and he joins the show to discuss Envoy Mobile. Matt describes how the networking challenges of mobile applications are similar to those of backend systems and cloud infrastructure. We discuss the advances in networking technology that Envoy Mobile helps bring to the mobile ecosystem, and also touch on the scalability challenges that Matt is seeing at Lyft.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the developed world, it is easy to take for granted that we grew up with computers. Technology is so pervasive in the United States that we have debates about how early in child development a human should be given a smartphone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across much of Africa, there is a shortage of access to computers. Children grow up without much exposure to computers at all. Smartphones are starting to proliferate the continent, but the bandwidth limitations prevent the sort of unrestricted mobile Internet usage that many of us have in the west.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tyler Cinnamon is a software engineer and the co-founder of TechLitAfrica, an organization dedicated to improving technology literacy and reducing poverty in Africa. TechLitAfrica takes old computers from the United States which are no longer in use and repurposes those computers with educational software and a downloaded subset of the Internet. Then, TechLitAfrica takes those computers to Africa and sets them up as computer labs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tyler joins the show to talk through the technical and cultural challenges of building TechLitAfrica.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hadoop ecosystem provided every company with the tools to store and query large amounts of data at a low cost. Since 2005, that ecosystem has expanded with more and more open source applications for data infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data infrastructure includes databases, data lakes, distributed queues, data warehouses, query engines, web applications, on-prem software, closed source, open source, cloud platforms, and software-as-a-service. There is so much software, and it is difficult to keep track of everything in the data engineering ecosystem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Africa to India to Asia to South America&#8211;computer science and programming are rising in popularity in every emerging market. Each of these markets has regional needs for technology. Just like every culture develops its own food and television, every culture needs different types of applications to run their lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Vietnam, the day-to-day life of a citizen is different than it is in the United States. Yes, everyone needs Google and YouTube and Instagram. But the trends in messaging, food delivery, gig economy, and other B2C technology sectors are considerably different than the west.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charles Lee is the founder of CoderSchool a coding school in Vietnam. Before moving to Vietnam to start CoderSchool, he worked as a software engineer in San Francisco for several years. In today’s show, Charles describes the difference between the US and Vietnamese technology sectors, from consumer applications to business software to coding education.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2011, Facebook had begun to focus its efforts on mobile development. Mobile phones did not have access to reliable, high bandwidth connections, and the Facebook engineering team needed to find a solution to improve the request latency between mobile clients and the backend Facebook infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One source of latency was recursive data fetching. If a mobile application client made a request to the backend for newsfeed, the backend API would return the newsfeed, but some components of that feed would require additional requests to the backend. In practice, this might result in a newsfeed loading partially on a phone, but having a delayed loading time for the comments of a newsfeed item.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GraphQL is a solution that came out of this problem of recursive data fetching. A GraphQL server provides middleware to aggregate all of the necessary information to serve a complete request. GraphQL connects to backend data sources and federates the frontend request across these different data sources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GraphQL was open sourced in 2015, and has found many use cases in addition to simplifying backend data fetching for mobile clients. Today, GraphQL is used by PayPal, Shopify, Twitter, and hundreds of other companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee Byron is the co-creator of GraphQL and he joins the show to tell the story of GraphQL, and how it fit into Facebook’s shift to mobile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook has released open source software projects that have changed the industry. The most impactful projects to date are the React frontend user interface tools: ReactJS and React Native.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before React became popular, there were multiple competing solutions for the dominant frontend JavaScript framework. React became the most prominent because of its invention of JSX, its one-way data flow, and the strength of its community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The React community is led by Facebook engineers. Facebook has a full-time team dedicated to improving React. Facebook also has the benefit of seeing the hardest problems in web development ahead of the rest of the industry, since Facebook is always pushing the leading edge of what software can do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As React evolves, Facebook itself is the first user of updates to the libraries. Engineers on the React team will proactively update the applications on other teams with new React code. In this way, Facebook&#8217;s React team is similar to a platform engineering team, except the open source community benefits from the improvements as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tom Occhino is an engineering director at Facebook. He joins the show to discuss his ten years of experience at the company and his role today as a senior leader in charge of open source developers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook generates high volumes of data at a rapid pace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dhruba Borthakur joined Facebook in 2008 to work on data infrastructure. His early projects at Facebook were around Hadoop, the distributed file system and MapReduce computation platform that laid the foundation for the “big data” movement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, Facebook was generating as much data as any other startup, and the company needed to stay at the leading edge of scalability techniques for its Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) cluster. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditionally, Hadoop managed its file system by synchronizing the coordination of the different data nodes with the help of a single master node. At Facebook, the scale of the data was such that the HDFS cluster had thousands of data nodes, which was too much volume for a single master node to handle. Dhruba helped implement redundancy at the master node to create a more resilient system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The early days of the big data movement was focused on batch processing. A company like Facebook would gather large amounts of data into databases and HDFS, and run offline analytics workloads to gather reports on an hourly, daily, or weekly basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, data infrastructure has moved closer to a “real time” processing model. Data infrastructure does not only support batch offline reporting&#8211;it also supports machine learning jobs that need to be run on a more frequent basis. These jobs have lower latency requirements, and have driven the adoption of in-memory stream processing systems like Spark and Flink.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dhruba joins the show to discuss his time at Facebook building data infrastructure. He takes us through the major projects he worked on, including the early Hadoop infrastructure, the refactoring of online user workloads to be more “pull” based than “push” based, and the creation of RocksDB, a storage engine he helped create at Facebook.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Dhruba is the CTO and co-founder of Rockset, a company that builds data infrastructure and database APIs on top of RocksDB. Rockset is building infrastructure for modern technology companies&#8211;many of which are facing problems that bear significant resemblance to the ones Facebook encountered as it scaled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Facebook’s early days, there was an emphasis on rapidly deploying new code to drive constant improvement and experimentation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product quality was maintained by engineers closely checking each other’s code reviews, rather than writing detailed unit testing suites. Facebook engineers had a sense for how the product should operate, and they were able to evaluate whether a new feature was working properly by testing a live version of that feature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Facebook, the vision of the company is clearly communicated to the employees. Every employee within Facebook can articulate the vision for the company, and will use similar language in describing that vision. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the employees are aligned on strategy, they can also align in their implementation of product features. This reduces conflicts across roles and between teams. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook has also shown a willingness to trust its engineers. Trust was exemplified by Facebook’s tolerance for failures in the early days. When an engineer broke a build, or shipped a feature that failed to gain traction, that engineer was usually not punished. They may have even been rewarded, if the company could learn significantly from such an error.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raylene Yung was an engineer at Facebook from 2009 to 2015. As she moved from individual contributor to manager to engineering director, Raylene worked on products including News Feed, Timeline, Privacy, and Sharing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raylene joins the show to give her reflections on the Facebook product and engineering environment. She explained how Facebook’s culture of collaboration, vision, and trust drive fast product development and minimizes conflict.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raylene left Facebook and joined Stripe, where she worked on payments systems and international expansion for almost four years.</span></p>

PHP allows developers to get web applications built quickly and easily, although PHP has a reputation for being difficult to scale. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the early days of Facebook, the company was scaling rapidly on every dimension. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New users were piling into Facebook. Existing users were increasing their interactions and developing new patterns of usage. The Facebook application was rolling out new features quickly, adding them into the Facebook PHP codebase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A common pattern for scaling a large software application is to use a microservices architecture, breaking up the monolithic application into small services which can scale independently. For many applications, this pattern works well. But for some applications, microservices makes less sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft Excel is one example. In Excel, a user is making updates to a complex data model using formulas, functions, and other in-app tools that need to be fast, performant, and integrated. The user needs to have a sense that the Excel data model will update quickly in response to changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A software team working on a spreadsheet product such as Excel might prefer to keep all the application logic in a monolithic application. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A monolith can centralize logic and make it easier to reason about. A monolith can reduce the number of network hops, cutting down on distributed systems problems. Testing and deploying a monolithic application can be less complex than doing so in a distributed, microservices system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook chose to scale its PHP monolith rather than breaking it up into distributed microservices. Scaling PHP allowed Facebook to continue moving fast without going through a painful refactoring that would have slowed down the entire company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first effort to scale PHP involved transpiling the entire PHP application into C++. This C++ version of Facebook ran faster and with a lower memory footprint. But C++ required ahead-of-time compilation: the PHP codebase had to be converted to C++ in one synchronous step.</span></p>
<p>The Hip Hop Virtual Machine (HHVM) is a just-in-time compiler that serves as an execution engine for PHP as well as Hack, a language that Facebook created as a dialect of PHP.</p>
<p>HHVM allows for dynamic execution of code that is written in PHP or Hack. The code is first transpiled into HHBC, a high-level bytecode format that serves as an intermediate language. This bytecode is dynamically executed by the HHVM. As a bytecode virtual machine, HHVM has similarities to V8, the JVM, or the CLR.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keith Adams was an engineer at Facebook for six years, where he helped develop infrastructure to scale PHP effectively. Keith is now the chief architect at Slack, which is also a scaled PHP application. Keith returns to Software Engineering Daily to discuss why and how Facebook scaled PHP.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data engineering allows a company to take advantage of the large quantities of data that the company has generated. In many companies, new data has been produced rapidly for many years, but the company has not been able to take full advantage of it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating large data sets does not provide immediate value for a company. A company needs to perform data engineering and data science to take full advantage of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When data gets generated, it is stored in a database, data lake, or API backend like Google Analytics. In order to manipulate that data, it is often pulled into a data warehouse. A data warehouse provides fast access time to large quantities of data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pulling data from a source like a database or data lake into a data warehouse requires a process known as extract and load. Once the data is in the data warehouse, it may also undergo a transform, which enriches the data or puts it in a format that is easier to make use of. Once data is in a data warehouse, it can be used to build models, interactive dashboards, and Jupyter Notebooks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data engineering lifecycle has many different components, which is why data engineering can often be intimidating to a company that is trying to make use of their data. Meltano is a project with the goal of providing a system of conventions for managing the data engineering lifecycle. Meltano was started by GitLab, and the Meltano project has some strategic similarities to GitLab.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Danielle Morill is the general manager of Meltano at GitLab. She joins the show to discuss the world of data engineering, and the architecture of Meltano. We touch on the different components of a data engineering pipeline, and the most acute pain points for data engineers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software engineers have a wide variety of media to choose from, including podcasts, blogs, YouTube videos, conferences. The amount of software engineering media that is available is growing and accelerating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eight years ago, there were not as many options for information about software. Charles Max Wood founded Devchat.tv to create a network of podcasts and other content for software engineers. Today, his podcasts include the popular shows </span><a href="https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">JavaScript Jabber</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruby Rogues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://devchat.tv/adv-in-angular/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adventures in Angular</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chuck joins the show for a conversation about software media. This was his second time on the show, with his </span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2015/10/20/javascript-jabber-with-charles-wood/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first episode exploring his podcast JavaScript Jabber</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software applications running within a host operating system need to be isolated. Isolation prevents security vulnerabilities, such as one application accessing the memory of another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In modern cloud environments, a single physical host might be running multiple virtual machines on top of a hypervisor. Those virtual machines might be divided up into containers. The different virtual machines and containers might be operated by different users, or even different companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">gVisor is a container sandbox runtime open sourced by Google. gVisor runs containers in a new user-space kernel, and provides a container security system with low overhead. gVisor improves on the previous security properties of containers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Pratt and Yoshi Tamura work on gVisor at Google, and they join the show to talk through the purpose of gVisor and the engineering around the project.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a software company has never been easier. Software engineers are increasingly seeing entrepreneurship as a viable career path. But the path to being an independent software developer is not always clear. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most engineers spend some of their career working at a software company. Even an engineer who intends to build a company someday can thrive within the right environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lior Kanfi is a software engineer and the founder of Tikal, a company he started at the height of the dot com bubble in 1999. His initial vision for the company was to build a product around managing knowledge and people within a company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the dot com bubble burst in the year 2000, it became much harder to run a product-focused business. Companies were not buying lots of experimental software, and investors were not aggressively funding new software companies. After the market collapsed, Lior shifted Tikal from a product-focused company into consulting, in order to have a more reliable income stream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Tikal is a successful software consultancy based in Israel and the Bay Area. Lior describes the engineers within Tikal as “free radical” software developers: independent people who want to learn about new technologies and build experience interacting with clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lior joins the show to talk about his 20 year journey building Tikal and the differences between engineers in the Bay Area and those in Israel. Lior also hosted the </span><a href="https://fullstackradar.tikalk.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full Stack Tech Radar Day in Tel Aviv</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which was a great conference I attended.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edge computing allows for faster data access and computation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When your client application makes a request, that request might be routed to the edge. Edge servers are more numerous and more widely distributed than normal data centers, but an edge server might not have all of the data or the complete application logic for the backend to serve your request.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edge servers have historically been used for content delivery networks (CDN). CDNs are useful for hosting and serving media files that might otherwise be slow to access over a network. More recently, applications are also using edge servers for computation, as well as storage of resources which are smaller than the movies, music, and images that have traditionally been stored on an edge server.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steve Klabnik is an engineer with Cloudflare, and he returns to the show to discuss storage at the edge. In Steve’s previous appearances we have explored Rust and WebAssembly, and we also touch on those topics in today’s episode.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ListenNotes allows users to find podcasts by categories, popularity, and search queries. ListenNotes is not a podcast client that you download onto your phone, but it allows users to build playlists. These playlists are automatically published to an RSS feed, so that users can curate a playlist on desktop and subscribe to that playlist from any client.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Podcasts are growing in popularity. There are more podcasts than ever before, and a podcast search engine needs to refresh its index regularly enough to capture the updates to the podcast universe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A podcast search engine needs to decide what to index. There are many potential fields to choose from within a podcast: the podcast title, the description, the audio transcription, and other metadata&#8211;should all of these factor into the results of a search engine?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wenbin Fang is the founder of ListenNotes, and the engineer who has built most of the application. He joins the show to talk about the world of podcasting and his work on ListenNotes, including the business model. Today, ListenNotes makes its money from advertisements and API requests&#8211;there is a growing market for applications that want an API for querying the ListenNotes backend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open source software allows developers to take code from the Internet and modify it for their own use. Open source has allowed innovation to occur on a massive scale. Today, open source software powers our consumer client applications and our backend cloud server infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Linux powers single node operating systems and Kubernetes is the foundation for new distributed systems. Hadoop created an open source distributed file system, Spark gave us a computational runtime on top of it, and Kafka created a middleware platform for shuttling data from one place to another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are numerous other examples of how open source has changed the world of software development. Open source has also reshaped the business landscape of infrastructure software companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A common business structure for a modern infrastructure company is the “open core” model. An open core company maintains an open source project that is free to use, but also sells a product or service around that product. Companies with an open core model include Red Hat, HashiCorp, and GitLab.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many companies are building a thriving business with the open core business model. But these companies do not directly control the most important part of the infrastructure supply chain: the cloud provider.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud providers have a fundamental tension with open core companies because the cloud providers offer services that compete with the open core companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the issue of cloud providers competing directly with the open core companies, some people have questioned whether Amazon Web Services is capturing an unfair portion of the value that is being created by open source.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Web Services is the biggest cloud provider, and it has built a large catalog of services that are built off of open source software. But AWS has not historically contributed heavily to open source relative to the value it has captured. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One example of an open core company which has lost market share to an AWS cloud-hosted offering is Elastic, the open core company which maintains the ElasticSearch open source project. Amazon ElasticSearch Service is a closed-source hosted offering built on top of the ElasticSearch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elastic (the company) has increasingly intermingled proprietary software with their open source repository, making it less clear how that open source repository can be used by companies that want to deploy it for their commercial use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open core companies such as MongoDB, Redis Labs, and Cockroach Labs have responded to the competitive pressures of AWS by changing their licenses and making it more expensive for cloud providers to offer a cloud-hosted offering of their open source project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dynamics between cloud providers and open core companies will continue to evolve in the coming years. The norms around open source are up for debate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joseph Jacks is the founder of OSS Capital, a venture firm focused on investments in commercial open source software companies. He returns to the show to discuss the changing landscape of open core companies, and the benefits of permissionless innovation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Earth allows users to explore the imagery of the real world. Imagery for Google Earth is taken from satellites, cars equipped with cameras, and other sources. Google Earth renders a data intensive 3-D model of the world on a client application such as a desktop browser or virtual reality system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WebAssembly is a runtime for executing code other than JavaScript in a browser-based environment. WebAssembly is useful for data-intensive workloads, and developers can use programming languages such as Rust or C++ in the browser by compiling to WebAssembly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jordon Mears works on Google Earth, and he joins the show to talk about the engineering behind Google Earth and how WebAssembly is being used to improve efficiency. He also discusses the state of tooling around WebAssembly today. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new database company needs to solve numerous problems in order to succeed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are already lots of existing database companies, so a new company needs to find a way to strongly differentiate itself. Databases are core infrastructure, so a new database company must earn trust with its customers. A database is a complicated distributed system, so a database company must have strong engineering to get its product to market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citus Data was founded in 2011. Around that time, companies were looking for solutions to both their online transactional workloads and their large-scale offline analytics workloads. Citus Data built its company around Postgres, a popular database that has been around since 1996. Products from Citus Data include a Postgres scalability extension as well as a cloud-hosted offering for spinning up Postgres instances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citus Data was acquired by Microsoft earlier this year. In today’s episode, Umur Cubukcu joins the show to talk about the story of the company from its early days to its eventual acquisition. Umur describes the landscape of data systems in 2011 when the company started, and explains how that evolved to the current ecosystem. Umur also talks about how to make an acquisition successful and gives some perspective on the future of data platforms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Programmers are in high demand, and software engineering is a career path that is fun, creative, and lucrative. There are many people who want to transition into a career in software and are looking for the right path toward writing code.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The traditional college computer science curriculum teaches some software engineering skills, but the time and financial cost of attending a university is prohibitive for many people who want to learn to code.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past decade, there have been several new models for software education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online video platforms such as Udacity and Coursera put computer science courses online to be watched at the viewer’s convenience. Online schools such as Free Code Camp allow someone to learn how to program without any experience, and with no financial payment. Boot camps with income-sharing agreements such as App Academy create an in-person education environment that mimics a university, but with better cost structure and incentive alignment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lambda School is an education system that takes elements of other software education models and combines them with newer SaaS technologies such as Slack and Zoom videoconferencing. Lambda School is an online software engineering curriculum with an income sharing agreement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Income sharing agreement” means that the student does not pay for their education until they get a job. With this model, the student can pay back Lambda School after their software engineering education gets them a high-paying software engineering job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Madsen works at Lambda School, and he joins the show to describe the path that a student takes through Lambda School, the school’s curriculum for software education, and how Lambda School differs from the other options for coding education.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A grocery store contains fruit, vegetables, meat, bread, and other items that can expire. In order to keep these items in stock, the store must be aware of how much food has been sold and what has gone bad. When a food item is low in stock, the store needs to order more of that food from a central distribution system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing food inventory is not simple. Some kinds of meat might expire faster than others. Avocados do not become ripe at the same rate as apples. In order to keep the shelves stocked, there are manual workflows for checking the inventory and ordering new inventory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afresh is a company that builds software for grocery stores. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afresh works with grocery chains that have a central distribution center. These grocery stores already have some software. At the back of the store, inventory management systems maintain records of the items that the store has on the shelves. At the front of the store, checkout systems detect what has been sold and help to update inventory. When the inventory is running low, the store can order more inventory from the central distribution center, so that trucks can deliver more inventory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afresh improves the operational intelligence of these stores by detecting spoilage among items that are prone to expiration, such as fruit. Volodomyr Kuleshov is the CTO and co-founder of Afresh and he joins the show to discuss the technical challenges of a grocery store, and the software that Afresh is building to make groceries more intelligent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software projects are organized and planned using project management software. Examples of project management software include JIRA, Trello, and Asana. There are hundreds of tools for managing a software project because there are infinite ways that a project could be managed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Docs changed project management by allowing documents to be easier to share and collaborate on. Newer SaaS tools such as Slack, Dropbox, and Notion have taken the design lessons from social networking apps to make enterprise software more engaging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the tools improve, our project management strategies change, and new software tools emerge to fit those new management strategies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kurt Schrader is the CEO of Clubhouse, a project management tool for software engineers. Kurt joins the show to talk about the history and future of project management tools. He also discusses the engineering challenges of improving performance on a complicated webapp. Project management tools often have to load hundreds of small objects on a page, which required performance optimizations in the Clubhouse frontend JavaScript library.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Niantic is the company behind Pokemon Go, an augmented reality game where users walk around in the real world and catch Pokemon which appear on their screen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea for augmented reality has existed for a long time. But the technology to bring augmented reality to the mass market has appeared only recently. Improved mobile technology makes it possible for a smartphone to display rendered 3-D images over a video stream without running out of battery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ingress was the first game to come out of Niantic, followed by Pokemon Go, but there are other games on the way. Niantic is also working on the Niantic Real World platform, a “planet-scale” AR platform that will allow independent developers to build multiplayer augmented reality experiences that are as dynamic and entertaining as Pokemon Go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul Franceus is an engineer at Niantic, and he joins the show to describe his experience building and launching Pokemon Go, as well as abstracting the technology from Pokemon Go and opening up the Niantic Real World platform to developers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WebAssembly allows for web-based execution of languages other than JavaScript. Programs written in Rust or C++ can be compiled down to WebAssembly and shipped over the browser for on-the-fly execution in a safe, memory controlled environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WebAssembly has been in development for more than two years, and is still an immature ecosystem because building the necessary tooling for WebAssembly is hard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the web has been built around JavaScript and the V8 JavaScript engine, which has been tuned to optimize an interpreted language (JavaScript). WebAssembly modules are often written in C++ or Rust, which are compiled languages. There are engineering challenges at the edge between the interpreted JavaScript runtime and the precompiled WebAssembly modules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Till Schneidereit is a senior research engineering manager at Mozilla. He joins the show to discuss the compilation path of WebAssembly and the state of the ecosystem.</span></p>

Today he works as the CEO of Rancher Labs, a company building a platform on top of Kubernetes. Sheng joins the show to discuss his experiences in the technology industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The container orchestration wars had many victims. The competing standards for how an enterprise should manage its numerous containers caused several companies to go down a path where they were building infrastructure which eventually had to be replaced. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Sheng discusses in today’s episode, the container orchestration wars almost killed his company. Rancher was originally built on top of a different container orchestrator, and the migration to Kubernetes required a massive rewrite of the Rancher platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The container orchestration wars were not the first technology battle that Sheng has seen in his career&#8211;and it won’t be his last. In today’s show, we discuss the nature of technology wars. Are they necessary? How can a software company minimize the damage caused by a war between competing standards?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sheng was an excellent guest and we didn’t cover nearly as many subjects as I wanted to, so we will have to do another show in the future!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kubernetes has made distributed systems easier to deploy and manage. As Kubernetes has become reliable, engineers have started to look for higher level abstractions we can define on top of Kubernetes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An operator is a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operators are useful for spinning up distributed systems such as Kafka, Redis, or MongoDB. These data systems are complicated, stateful applications with lots of failure domains. The operator framework enables a developer to deploy one of these complicated applications with less fear of the system crashing, or entering an erroneous state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rob Szumski is an engineer at Red Hat. He joins the show to discuss Kubernetes, the operator pattern, and his time at CoreOS, which was acquired by Red Hat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud computing was popularized in 2006 with the launch of Amazon Web Services. AWS allowed developers to use remote server infrastructure with a simple set of APIs. But even with AWS, it was still not simple to deploy and manage a web application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2007, Heroku launched a platform built on top of AWS. Heroku focused on the developer experience by optimizing for users who were deploying Ruby on Rails applications. Since then, Heroku has expanded into other forms of managed infrastructure, including other application frameworks like NodeJS, and databases like Postgres.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heroku was the first popular “layer 2” cloud provider. Twelve years later, it is probably still the most popular. But there have been many other cloud providers built on top of AWS, including Netlify, Zeit, Spotinst, and Firebase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Layer 1 cloud providers are Google Cloud, AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean, and other raw infrastructure providers. These companies provide a great service in their low cost, commodity infrastructure. But the layer 1 providers are not optimizing for developer experience. They need to cater to a broad set of developers, some of whom want to work at a low level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A layer 2 cloud provider can build an opinionated solution that serves a subset of the overall cloud market particularly well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Render is a layer 2 cloud provider that optimizes for specific developer workflows, such as deploying a NodeJS web server, a static site, or a Docker container. Anurag Goel is the founder of Render, and he joins the show to discuss the strategy and the economics of Render. Anurag was also one of the early employees at Stripe, and he discusses his experience and learnings from working at the company.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software engineering is an art and a science. To manage engineers is to manage artists and scientists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software companies build practical tools like payment systems, messaging products, and search engines. Software tools are the underpinnings of our modern lives. You might expect this core infrastructure which modern humans rely on to have been constructed with pure formulaic rigor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the best software tools are not built within a totally defined process. Software is built through messy iteration. When a piece of software looks pristine, that is often a function of how many mistakes have been made, and then subsequently corrected for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no fixed process for how to build good software. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As our tools get better, we have to update our software engineering practices to utilize those new tools. We have to rethink the style that we are working in. We have to discard old tools and procedures in order to pick up the new ones, and have higher leverage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an organization scales, the structure of the organization needs to be modified. Team members need to be reallocated. Checks and balances need to be put in place. Rules and cultural practices need to codified, because a larger organization cannot have ties broken by an individual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software is built by humans, and every management decision must be considered in the light of human psychology. When we change a line of code, the code does not get emotional about being altered. But the same cannot be said of humans. Even a minor conversation between an engineering manager and a direct report can have lasting implications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will Larson is the author of </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Puzzle-Systems-Engineering-Management/dp/1732265186"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning allows software to improve as that software consumes more data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machine learning is a tool that every software engineer wants to be able to use. Because machine learning is so broadly applicable, software companies want to make the tools more accessible to the developers across the organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many steps that an engineer must go through to use machine learning, and each additional step inhibits the chances that the engineer will actually get their model into production.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An engineer who wants to build machine learning into their application needs access to data sets. They need to join those data sets, and load them into a machine (or multiple machines) where their model can be trained. Once the model is trained, the model needs to test on additional data to ensure quality. If the initial model quality is insufficient, the engineer might need to tweak the training parameters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once a model is accurate enough, the engineer needs to deploy that model. After deployment, the model might need to be updated with new data later on. If the model is processing sensitive or financially relevant data, a provenance process might be necessary to allow for an audit trail of decisions that have been made by the model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rob Story and Kelley Rivoire are engineers working on machine learning infrastructure at Stripe. After recognizing the difficulties that engineers faced in creating and deploying machine learning models, Stripe engineers built out Railyard, an API for machine learning workloads within the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rob and Kelley join the show to discuss data engineering and machine learning at Stripe, and their work on Railyard. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The software market changes every year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As individuals and enterprises become more willing to buy software, there are new markets for entrepreneurs to sell software to. Good software has high margins and high retention, so even a niche software business can prove profitable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As software spreads across the world, developing countries are showing a willingness to buy the same software tools as the developed countries, making the niche software businesses even more successful than expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a great time to start a software business. But the fundamental challenges faced by an entrepreneur have not gone away. An entrepreneur must find the necessary capital, build an initial product, iterate on that product, market to their audience, sell to their customers, and retain their users.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Cloud was started with a vision of providing Google infrastructure to the masses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2008, it was not obvious that Google should become a cloud provider. Amazon Web Services was finding success among startups who needed on-demand infrastructure, but the traditional enterprise market was not yet ready to buy cloud resources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Googlers liked the idea of becoming a cloud provider. But was it the right time to enter the market? Google’s advertising business was a large and growing cash cow. Executives within Google were not sure how much capital and effort should be allocated into an infrastructure business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Google decided to go into the cloud business, Joe Beda was one of the engineers who helped lead the effort, and joins the show as today’s guest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google’s internal server infrastructure is managed by Borg, a system for allocating resources to applications. Google Cloud runs on Borg, and there were a number of early engineering challenges to building the necessary functionality into Borg for running a cloud provider on top of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One example of a technical challenge that Google faced was the refactoring of Borg to run Google Cloud workloads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The requirements for public infrastructure are different than those of internal Googlers. Inside of Google, developers deploy their applications to containers running on bare metal. Outside of Google, developers want to create virtual machines. Borg needed to be refactored in order to instantiate VMs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google solved this technical problem, as well as many other challenges, and Google Cloud slowly gained momentum in the market. But AWS remained the default choice for profitable enterprise workloads. It wasn’t until the container orchestration wars that Google found an opportunity to jump on a market segment that offered strong differentiation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By open sourcing Kubernetes and presenting a clear vision for where the project was going, Google shifted the battlefield of the public cloud toward a competitive landscape where it has many advantages. Kubernetes also provided many other technology companies with an opportunity to get into the cloud market, creating a collaborative, multi-company ecosystem that has accelerated the pace of software faster than anyone expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Beda has been instrumental in the evolution of the cloud native ecosystem. In today’s episode, Joe gives his memories on Google Cloud, Kubernetes, and his Kubernetes company Heptio, which he sold to VMware.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your application does not maintain state, then shutting it down in the middle of a computation is not a problem&#8211;you can just restart the application, restart your computation, and get the same result.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But applications need to maintain state. We need to use databases and in-memory systems to manage long-lived user sessions and other interactions. A database is not just an on-disk abstraction&#8211;a database requires an application server to be accepting network traffic. We can run those database applications within containers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a fundamental tension between stateful applications and the idea that containers are meant to tolerate failure gracefully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Web Services is the leading cloud provider by a large margin. Amazon established its lead by being first to market in 2006, with Google and Microsoft taking several years to catch up to the huge business opportunity of the cloud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2008, Google Cloud has been working on cloud products for developers. It started with App Engine, which is widely used internally at Google, but has not had overwhelming public adoption. Over the last eleven years, Google has refined its understanding of how customers want to buy public cloud resources. Google Cloud products like Cloud Storage, Persistent Disk, and BigTable have given Google parity with many of the AWS public cloud offerings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Google has caught up to AWS in terms of products, the enterprise market has continued to choose AWS as its default. AWS is widely perceived as  having more experience in running enterprise workloads, and a better responsiveness to customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to keep Amazon from running away with the cloud market entirely, Google needed to shift the competitive landscape to different territory. Kubernetes provided the paradigm shift that Google needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market for cloud providers has changed completely due to Kubernetes. When Google open sourced Kubernetes, it created a common codebase for software companies to build software for managing distributed systems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the span of five years, Kubernetes has turned the world of cloud products into a world resembling the open source Linux ecosystem. This is a remarkable shift, and every infrastructure software vendor is still figuring out its strategy for adapting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adam Glick is the head of modern infrastructure and serverless marketing at Google. With Craig Box, he hosts the Kubernetes Podcast from Google, an excellent show about recent developments and evergreen concepts within the world of Kubernetes. Prior to Google, Adam worked at AWS for 3 years and Microsoft for twelve years. He has seen each of the major cloud providers up close and has a deep awareness for how each company thinks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had a great conversation about the cloud native landscape, podcasting, and developer marketing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Containers offer a lightweight abstraction for running a server. Cloud providers are able to manage billions of containers from different users, allowing for economies of scale so that each user can pay less.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, there is a variety of ways that users can deploy containers on a cloud provider. These containers can run in managed Kubernetes clusters, in functions-as-a-service, or in long-lived standalone container instances. User preferences are getting more sophisticated, with some users showing an interest in Knative, an open source serverless system originally created at Google.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whichever container deployment system you choose, your application and its multiple servers need a way to route traffic, measure telemetry, and configure security policy. A service mesh abstraction can help serve these use cases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lachlan Evenson has worked in containers and Kubernetes since before the container orchestration wars. He was an engineer at Deis, a company which built an open source platform-as-a-service running on top of containers and Kubernetes. Deis was acquired by Microsoft, where Lachlan now works as principal program manager of Container Compute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lachlan joins the show to discuss containers, Kubernetes, and the Service Mesh Interface, an interoperable service mesh layer that Microsoft launched with Buoyant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each cloud provider offers a different set of services which are not always compatible with each other. What are the challenges of building an application that interoperates with multiple different clouds?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first issue is API compatibility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most cloud providers have a managed SQL offering, a bucket storage system, and server abstractions like virtual machines and containers. But these tools might have different APIs on each cloud. The code that you wrote to save your application data to Amazon S3 might have to be rewritten if you decide to switch your bucket storage to a different provider.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another issue that interferes with cloud interoperability is the degree of integration on a particular cloud. If I build my application for AWS, I might be heavily integrated with Amazon’s Identity and Access Management policy system and AWS logging. Each cloud provider makes it particularly easy to connect to their integrated solutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also the problem of services on one cloud that simply do not map to a service on any other cloud. Google Cloud Bigtable does not have an equivalent service on Amazon. Microsoft CosmosDB does not have an equivalent service on Digital Ocean.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As developers, this irritates us. We want to be able to deploy our application to any cloud. We want to be able to move applications easily from one cloud to another. And we want to mix tools from different clouds together as easily as we import a library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bassam Tabbara is the CEO of Upbound, a company focused on making multicloud applications easier to deploy and operate. I spoke to Bassam at KubeCon EU 2019, and he described the problems of multicloud deployments and the opportunities for the cloud native ecosystem to become more cross-compatible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google’s cloud business was long regarded as a place where startups could build a business, but not established enterprises. For serious workloads, enterprises chose Amazon almost unanimously. This phenomenon of Amazon as the default was described by a phrase that harkened back to the days of IBM’s dominance: “nobody ever got fired for choosing AWS.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the rise of Kubernetes, Google has established a reputation as a reliable provider of container orchestration. As enterprises look to roll out Kubernetes workloads, Google is convincing many of them to work with Google Kubernetes Engine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kubernetes is one part of the changes which fall under the description of “digital transformation”. As these enterprises build out their digital transformation strategy, they are also looking for a strategy around multicloud, on-prem, policy management, and consulting partnerships. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthos is a platform where enterprises manage the resources and configuration of their cloud deployments, as well as a system to partner with services integrators and independent software vendors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aparna Sinha works on Anthos, Google Kubernetes Engine, and other projects at Google. In today’s show we discuss the process of digital transformation, as well as the tactics for how a digital transformation is actually implemented. We also talked about GKE on-prem, and the kinds of tooling needed by on-prem application deployments.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A service mesh is an abstraction that provides traffic routing, policy management, and telemetry for a distributed application. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A service mesh consists of a data plane and a control plane. In the data plane, a proxy runs alongside each service, with every request from a service being routed through the proxy. In the control plane, an application owner can control the behavior of the proxies distributed throughout the application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the Kubernetes ecosystem has developed, the service mesh abstraction has become an increasingly desirable component of a “cloud native” application stack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As companies enthusiastically adopt Kubernetes, they eventually find themselves with a large distributed system that is difficult to operate. A service mesh simplifies some of these operational difficulties, </span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/?s=service+mesh"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as we have explored in numerous previous episodes.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kubernetes community has grown to include lots of enterprises, and those enterprises want to adopt service mesh. But today, many of them are afraid to adopt the technology because there are multiple competing products, and it is unclear which one the community will centralize around&#8211;or if the community will end up supporting multiple products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next few weeks, we will be airing interviews from KubeCon EU 2019 in Barcelona. These interviews are a window into the world of the Kubernetes and the cloud-native ecosystem, which is transforming the world of infrastructure software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most prominent theme across these shows was that of service mesh. Why was service mesh such an important topic? Because the battle for service mesh supremacy is a classic technology competition between a giant incumbent and a startup with far fewer resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kubernetes ecosystem is beautifully engineered to allow for a marketplace of warring ideas where the most worthy competitor wins out&#8211;but in some cases there is room for multiple products to occupy different subsections of the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across these episodes, one theme we will explore is the governance and the diplomacy of these competing solutions, and how the Kubernetes ecosystem is structured to allow for harmonious resolution to technology battles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is tempting to look at this competition between service meshes as winner-take-all. But as of late May 2019, we do not yet know if it will be winner-take-all. In order to predict how the service mesh wars will play out, the best we can do is to look at historical examples.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Container orchestration wars was a winner-take-all market. Container orchestration was a problem of such depth, such technical complexity and integration, that there had to be a single winner for the ecosystem to marshall around. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the container orchestration wars, as Mesos and Docker Swarm and HashiCorp Nomad and Kubernetes fought for supremacy, many large enterprises made bets on container orchestration systems that were not Kubernetes. When the dust settled, Kubernetes was the victor, and these large enterprises who had adopted orchestration systems other than Kubernetes begrudgingly began thinking about how to migrate to Kubernetes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But during the orchestration wars, many more enterprises were sitting out altogether. They did not choose Kubernetes or Mesos or Swarm. They chose to wait.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enterprise technologists are smart, and they can tell when a technology is immature. Although many enterprises wanted an orchestration system to manage their Docker containers, they did not want to insert a heavy abstraction that they would have to tear out later on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once Kubernetes won the orchestration wars, enterprise dollars piled into the space. The cloud native community has grown faster than anyone expected, because we solved the collective action problem of centralizing on a container orchestrator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From enterprises to cloud providers to ISVs to podcasters, we share the same vision for Kubernetes: it is the Linux for distributed systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the Kubernetes ecosystem, the thought leadership tries not to pick winners. It is better for everyone if the winners are decided through competition. In order to foster competition, interfaces into Kubernetes can provide a layer of standardization along which different products can compete. Enterprises can buy into an interface without buying into any particular product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples include the container networking interface (CNI) and the container storage interface (CSI). Every Kubernetes application wants storage and networking, but these Kubernetes applications do not want to be locked into a particular provider. Since there is a standardized interface for networking and storage, these applications can swap out one storage provider for another, or one networking provider for another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does this relate to service mesh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the service mesh market, Buoyant was first to market with its open source project Linkerd. Today’s guest William Morgan is the CEO of Buoyant. Over the last four years, Linkerd has slowly grown a following of dedicated users who run the open source service mesh in production. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last four years, Linkerd has changed from its initial technology of the embedded JVM service proxy developed at Twitter to a Rust-based sidecar data plane and a Go-based control plane. Buoyant’s dedicated focus to the service mesh space has won over much of the community, as was evidenced by Linkerd becoming the predominant apparel brand at Kubecon EU 2019: Linkerd hats and t-shirts were everywhere at the conference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why did Linkerd become trendy? Ironically, because of a competing service mesh whose launch strategy was widely seen as an affront to the spirit of the cloud native community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Istio was created within Google, and launched with a set of brittle partnerships with IBM and other companies. Istio careened into the Kubernetes ecosystem with violent fanfare, trumpeting itself as the cloud native service mesh du jour through endless banner ads, marketing email campaigns, and KubeCon programming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any listener to this podcast knows I am as gullible as any technologist. I’m an idealist&#8211;and I wanted to believe that Istio represented the service mesh equivalent of Kubernetes. It’s from Google, it launched with a bunch of impressive logos, and it has an inspiring vision. Looks cloud native, smells cloud native, must be cloud native, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, Istio’s early marketing aggrandizements were disconnected from the nascent realities of the project. Istio was buggy and difficult to set up. Istio quickly developed a reputation as Google-manufactured vaporware: nice idea, not nearly ready for production.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Linkerd, the timing could not have been better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Istio’s romantic vision of an operating plane for routing traffic, managing security policy, and measuring network telemetry had seduced the enterprise masses. With their cravings unmet by Istio, these enterprises surveyed the market and quickly found their way to Linkerd, the humble service mesh next door, who had been waiting patiently all along.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tide has turned against Istio, and towards Linkerd. But the service mesh wars have just begun. And as easy as it is to criticize Istio, the project is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> only vaporware. Istio has a vision for a detailed operating plane that will evolve together with Envoy, a service proxy sidecar developed at Lyft. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps Istio’s early embers had too much marketing gasoline poured on them initially, but the project could still succeed. Google is the most sophisticated, well-resourced company in the world&#8211;and judging from Google’s adjacent strategic messaging around Anthos and other strategic initiatives, the company has already decided that Istio will be around for the long haul. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a community, we should be grateful to witness the folly of Istio’s carpet-bomb marketing strategy. It is validation for the earnest resilience of the cloud native community, that even under the omnipresent duress of Google marketing, the community was able to collectively reject the Istio Kool Aid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This should come as no surprise. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation resides within the Linux Foundation, and the Kubernetes ecosystem has been ordained with the ardent technical purity of Linus Torvalds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CNCF was formed under the looming shadow of AWS. The CNCF was seeded with the donation of Kubernetes by Google. Much like the Linux community was positioned as a rebellious movement in reaction to Microsoft’s dominance, the Kubernetes community represents a fervent desire to open up the market to cloud providers beyond the tight-lipped, proprietary dominion of Amazon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With such a deep spirit of insubordination, it is no surprise that the community has rejected Istio like a set of loosely coupled organs rejecting a foreign skin attempting to layer itself across them. Even though the CNCF was founded by Google, the community was formed in spite of big centralized clouds, not as a marketing vessel for their products which may or may not be open source. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft seems to understand this fact better than Google, at least in the domain of service mesh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The day after this interview with William, Microsoft announced the Service Mesh Interface (SMI), a project it partnered with Buoyant and other companies on to create a minimal spec for what a service mesh should offer to a Kubernetes deployment. The SMI presents a safe buy-in point for enterprises who want a service mesh, but do not want to get caught in the evangelistic crossfire of Istio and Linkerd.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is in this environment that we begin our next series of shows on the current cloud native ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation for putting together an amazing podcasting zone at KubeCon, and allowing me to conduct these interviews.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud computing, open source, and mobile computing are trends that affect every organization. When a large organization adapts to these trends, it is commonly referred to as a “digital transformation”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital transformation causes many companies to reframe their business as a software company. A candy manufacturer now must think of itself as a software company that makes candy. An insurance company must now think of itself as a software company that issues insurance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capital One is a bank that was started in 1988. Capital One has always had an emphasis on software, but the company’s digital transformation has affected it as much any other company. The company is migrating to the cloud, building out microservices, rolling out continuous delivery pipelines, and shifting the internal culture to be more adept at using software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hillary McTigue is a senior director of data engineering at Capital One. She joins the show to discuss her experience implementing a digital transformation within a large company. Subjects we discuss include culture, management strategy, and the sequencing of different phases of a digital transformation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Netflix started with a DVD-by-mail product. The software infrastructure and operations practices needed for the DVD business were very different from those needed by a streaming video company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the early days of Netflix, CEO Reed Hastings knew that the company would evolve to becoming a streaming video platform. But he did not know when the technology would be advanced enough to support video streaming, and he did not know how users would consume it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greg Burrell has worked at Netflix for 14 years. Greg was one of the first engineers to start working on video streaming, which Netflix first attempted to implement with a set top box that downloaded movies and played them on your television. After evolving this strategy, Netflix arrived at the current model of video streaming through apps on browsers and mobile devices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the company pivoted from DVD-by-mail to video streaming, Netflix encountered multiple challenges across engineering, operations, and communications across the company. At the time, there was no “DevOps” movement. There were not established continuous delivery practices. The available cloud technologies were immature and low level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greg joins the show to describe the evolutionary arc of Netflix’s engineering process. </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSERd2Brwwbiz_F-RJdaCrnizfTrAxBgtS8vggk08pFeoNy5Lf_iUZGufH0vrY0Frr3sUl6HOfZlDsl/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000&amp;slide=id.g5773dbfab0_0_80"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greg also presents a model for software development that he describes as “Full Cycle Development”.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> At Netflix, engineering teams of full cycle developers work without dedicated operations or testing teams. It is a sophisticated approach to engineering management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spoke to Greg at the </span><a href="https://fullstackradar.tikalk.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fullstack Tech Radar Day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a software conference in Tel-Aviv put on by </span><a href="https://www.tikalk.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tikal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an engineering community based out of Israel and San Francisco. This was a great conference, and we’ll be airing some additional content from it in the coming weeks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Augmented reality applications can be used on smartphones and dedicated AR headsets. On smartphones, ARCore (Google) and ARKit (Apple) allow developers to build for the camera on a user’s smartphone. AR headsets such as Microsoft HoloLens and Magic Leap allow for a futuristic augmented reality headset experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most prominent use of augmented reality today is gaming, with a notable example being Niantic’s Pokemon Go. Tony Godar is a software engineer who works on augmented and virtual reality applications. He joins the show to talk about his day job working on virtual reality experiences, and an AR game he built called ARhythm.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://findcollabs.com/project/EiZppbiwlpHfBgbC0ADq"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tony was the winner of the FindCollabs Hackathon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and we also discussed his experience working on the project through FindCollabs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RECENT UPDATES:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://findcollabs.com/open"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FindCollabs Open has started. It is our second FindCollabs hackathon, and we are giving away $2500 in prizes.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CamelCamelCamel is a tool for tracking prices on items on Amazon.com. The company was launched eleven years ago and is built off of the Amazon Product Advertising API. Daniel Green is one of the founders of CamelCamelCamel, and he joins the show to describe his experience building the product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon and CamelCamelCamel (C3) have a complex relationship. C3 makes its money from referral listings. When a user tracks the price of an Amazon item using C3, that user will probably eventually click on the referral listing on C3. If the user purchases the item on Amazon, C3 gets a percentage of the purchase from Amazon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C3 has millions of product listings where they are tracking the price of items on Amazon. They have created a directory with a large subset of Amazon’s items by leveraging an API that was originally meant for advertising. Whether or not this is a proper use of the API, C3 arguably leads to more purchasing volume on Amazon&#8211;which is ostensibly why Amazon lets the company continue to operate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s show, Daniel gives a history of CamelCamelCamel, including his own background as an engineer working in finance and how he wound up working on C3 for the past decade. We also talk through how C3 is architected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaming is becoming mainstream. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Popular multiplayer games such as Fortnite and Minecraft present players with a massive virtual world to explore, build, and compete within. Turn-based games such as Hearthstone and Magic are breeding a new generation of board game and card game aficionados. Social media networks like Twitch and YouTube have turned gaming into a voyeuristic sport that is outcompeting many physical sports games for attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guilded is a platform for managing gaming teams. On Guilded, there are teams for games like League of Legends, Fortnite, and World of Warcraft. These teams use Guilded to manage calendars, Discord bots, forum software, documents, statistics, and recruiting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This might sound confusing&#8211;why does a gaming team need document management, calendars, and analytics? Are we talking about a video game team or a software company? To understand Guilded, you need to understand the rapidly changing modern gaming ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eli Brown is a founder of Guilded.gg. He joins the show to talk about the world of gaming, its intersection with social media, and the fascinating engineering problems involved in building a platform for gaming teams.</span></p>

An engineer at Google can explore almost any area of the codebase within the entire company. In order to enable this, Google has built tooling to support the monolithic repo, including a virtual file system and a set of build tools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A monolithic repository is not to be confused with a monolithic deployment. Google’s infrastructure consists of thousands of small services interacting over a network, and scaling individually. But all of the code for each of these different independent modules is in the same version control system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ciera Jaspan is a staff software engineer at Google working on developer infrastructure. She worked on an internal research project within Google to find out how engineers felt about the monolithic repository system and how it compared to a large number of small repositories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ciera joins the show to discuss repository management, internal tooling, and Google’s approach to researching developer productivity within the company.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex Balazs is the Intuit Chief Architect and has been working at the company for almost twenty years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intuit’s products include QuickBooks, TurboTax, and Mint. These applications are used to file taxes, manage business invoices, conduct personal accounting, and other critical aspects of a user’s financial life. Because the applications are managing money for users, there is not much room for error.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Intuit was started, the company made desktop software. In his time at Intuit, Alex played a key role in rearchitecting the monolithic desktop applications to be resilient, reliable web applications. Intuit originally managed this software on their own servers. Since then, Intuit has migrated to the cloud using AWS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex joins the show to discuss his experience scaling Intuit, his strategy for cloud migration, and his evaluation criteria for questions of build versus buy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa is rapidly adopting the same software and hardware technologies that have transformed the western world over the last few decades. But access to computers and technology education is still uneven. Where there is access to computers, smartphone adoption often comes before access to laptops or desktop computers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nelly Cheboi is the founder of TechLit Africa, an organization that works to connect schools and families in Africa with computers and software. Nelly studied computer science, and worked as a software engineer before leaving her career to focus full-time on building a scalable model to take refurbished computers and give them to Africans who can make good use of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechLit Africa is also building a software stack to equip schools in Africa without an Internet connection with an internal subnet including Wikipedia and other educational resources, so that people in the school can get an Internet-like experience despite a lack of access to the full Internet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook’s strategy is shaped by long term goals, short term requirements, and the available resources of the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long term goals are necessary for thinking through big decisions such as acquisitions, hardware product investments, and open source software ecosystems. To implement long term goals, Facebook needs to communicate the vision of the company and foster an internal culture that supports that vision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short term requirements can affect how the company is thinking on a more immediate time horizon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Facebook realized the importance of mobile computing, the mentality in the company quickly shifted from looking at mobile as a tax on engineering resources to a long-term source of business value. When Google started to work on Google+, Facebook engineers focused their resources on the potential competitive threat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook’s strategy is implemented by the engineers, product managers, and other employees of the company. Facebook is unique in its ability to allow those employees to self-assemble into work that is meaningful to the individuals as well as to the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the long term goals and short term requirements of Facebook change over time, company resources are shifted to focus the company on the correct set of priorities. Some of those priorities might be speculative investments in new technologies. Other priorities might include doubling down on areas of the company that are showing promise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Vernal worked as a VP of product and engineering at Facebook for 8 years. He left the company in 2016 and joined Sequoia Capital, where he now works as a partner. In his time at Facebook, he helped architect and implement strategies relating to product direction and engineering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike joins the show for a discussion about his time at Facebook and the strategic lessons that he learned from his time at the company.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">React is a set of open source tools for building user interfaces. React was open sourced by Facebook, and includes libraries for creating interfaces on the web (ReactJS) and on mobile devices (React Native).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">React was released during a time when there was not a dominant frontend JavaScript library. Backbone, Angular, and other JavaScript frameworks were all popular, but there was not any consolidation across the frontend web development community. Before React came out, frontend developers were fractured into different communities for the different JavaScript frameworks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Facebook open sourced React, web developers began to gravitate towards the framework for its one-way data flow and its unconventional style of putting JavaScript and HTML together in a format called JSX. As React has grown in popularity, the React ecosystem has developed network effects. In many cases, the easiest way to build a web application frontend is to compose together open source React components.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After seeing the initial traction, Facebook invested heavily into React, creating entire teams within the company whose goal was to improve React. Dan Abramov works on the React team at Facebook and joins the show to talk about how the React project is managed and his vision for the project.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook engineering is designed to self-assemble. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When an engineer joins Facebook, the engineer goes through boot camp, where they are exposed to multiple projects to find a good fit in terms of technical skills and personal preferences. Since there are so many different initiatives within the company at any given moment, a new hire can usually find something to work on through this exploration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an engineer builds credibility within Facebook, opportunities to move to other projects or to become a manager will present themselves, allowing the engineer to move within the company as they mature and their interests change. The sense of autonomy and freedom to explore is one feature of Facebook engineering that distinguishes the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook is a flat, decentralized organization by nature. But there have been existential moments in Facebook’s history where an executive mandate was required. During these existential situations, Facebook centralizes and becomes a more top-down environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook’s most crucial inflection point to date was its shift to focusing on mobile computing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even two years after the launch of the iPhone, it was not obvious that the world of consumer computing would change completely due to mobile devices. Facebook was becoming a dominant place where consumers navigated to on desktop, and Facebook engineering was focused on optimizing that desktop experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the impact of the iPhone became noticeable, Facebook found itself with a desktop web product in the middle of a platform shift away from the desktop. During this same time, Facebook was beginning to succeed with its advertising platform and was evaluating an initial public offering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook leadership was able to recognize the importance of mobile computing in time to develop high quality mobile applications, but there were numerous challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Facebook desktop web app had been difficult enough to build due to the unprecedented data requirements and amount of interactivity. Mobile introduced the additional hurdles of limited bandwidth and distinct native operating systems in Android and iPhone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook’s early efforts to build a mobile application involved a cross-platform HTML5 solution. HTML5 had insufficient performance for Facebook’s needs, and the company needed to develop native apps in order to deliver the desired experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook’s ability to pivot to mobile is comparable to </span><a href="https://anthonysmoak.com/2016/03/27/andy-grove-and-intels-move-from-memory-to-microprocessors/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the classic story of Intel pivoting from a memory company to a microprocessor company.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> To succeed at mobile application development, Facebook had to shift its focus dramatically, reallocating engineering resources and acqui-hiring small mobile companies in order to build up the domain expertise for mobile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a side effect of this transition to mobile, Facebook developed an understanding of how dramatically software engineering was changed by the introduction of smartphones and the high bandwidth requirements of social networking. The challenges of this new paradigm led to the development of open source tools such as GraphQL and React Native, which have allowed countless projects to build applications more easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jocelyn Goldfein was an engineering director at Facebook for four years, from 2010 to 2014. She currently works as an investor at Zetta Venture Partners. In her time at Facebook, Jocelyn saw the shift to mobile firsthand. In today’s episode, she describes how Facebook management works, and gives her perspective on the distinguishing characteristics of the engineering organization as a whole.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Facebook was scaling in its early years, the company developed engineering practices that were unlike any other organization before it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early Facebook engineering developed unusual practices because the problem set was unusual. Facebook was a highly detailed, highly interactive, multi-user web application. Facebook was pushing the limits of PHP and JavaScript in a time when there were not simple frameworks to help with user interface development and data fetching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to unique engineering problems, the Facebook product itself was also unique. When a product has as much traction as Facebook did in the early days, how are you supposed to manage the direction of that product?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should you double down on the core competency of the product, and make it as good as possible at simply connecting friends to each other? Or should you rapidly expand into adjacent systems like messaging, groups, and photos? How should you allocate developer resources when you have problems to be solved at every layer of the stack, from backend infrastructure to frontend performance?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a typical company, you would put all these engineering problems and product opportunities into some kind of project management software and assign developers to work on them, and gradually make steady, measured progress. The downside of that approach is that it slows down the pace of product creation and experimentation, and turns software development into a top-down, bureaucratic process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Facebook, developers self-assembled into teams that did what needed to be done. The engineers who were the most productive and charismatic could quickly build a reputation for themselves and become technical leaders. These “influencer engineers” within Facebook had a proven track record, and would become magnets for other engineers who wanted to contribute to the projects with the most momentum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook is a case study in the ability for developers to self-organize into groups who are working on projects that are meaningful to the company and personally satisfying to the individual engineers. Many engineers in the software industry work under a less capable manager who has complete control over their creativity. This leads to employee churn, dissatisfaction, and burnout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook’s ability to move fast is predicated on its ability to match engineers with problems that are interesting to those particular individuals. Whether you want to work on newsfeed or developer productivity tools or machine learning research, there is a path within Facebook to finding a problem that is both important and fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook’s unique set of engineering challenges required the company to develop a unique set of internal tools. Because Facebook had data and throughput requirements which were unprecedented, the available tools and best practices at the time did not satisfy Facebook’s requirements. Over the years, Facebook has developed its own databases, caching strategies, and JavaScript frameworks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nick Schrock worked at Facebook for eight years. He is best known as a co-creator of GraphQL, a tool for efficiently fetching data through a federated request language. GraphQL was the result of years of evolution of internal tooling within Facebook.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nick has discussed the creation of GraphQL in other podcasts, and we will have a more dedicated episode around a retrospective of GraphQL in the near future. Today’s episode is about the process by which developers at Facebook self-organized, and Nick’s ideas around how to identify a need for an internal tool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since leaving Facebook, Nick has parlayed his experience in developer tools into </span><a href="https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dagster</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a programming model for data applications.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook engineering is commonly described by two words: move fast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building products quickly has been a differentiating characteristic of the company since its inception. From the longtime engineers to the summer interns, Facebook instills a sense of immediacy and opportunity in all of its employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of Facebook is to make the world more open and transparent, with the intention of creating greater understanding and connection through Internet services. More than any other company in history, Facebook has enabled people to communicate with each other via simple user interfaces and real, authenticated human identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook must move fast, because the vision for Facebook is without precedent. It may feel like the Facebook mission is already finished, because you can already use Facebook to connect with anyone across the world with an Internet connection. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But once you are connected to somebody on Facebook, there are only a small number of interactions you can take: sending a message, sharing a photo, broadcasting a video stream. There are so many more parts of our lives waiting to be digitized, and many of these require a real identity system to work properly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than any other company, Facebook is positioned to expand our system of real-world human trust onto the Internet. The depth and breadth of the engineering problems required to accomplish this demands that Facebook move fast. To move slower would cause all of us to pay the opportunity cost of having to wait longer to interconnect our global society.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pete Hunt worked as an engineer at Facebook for three and a half years. At Facebook, he helped build React, a set of technologies that have significantly improved frontend application interface development. After the Instagram acquisition, Pete was the first engineer from Facebook to join the Instagram team to help bring the two companies together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pete left Facebook in 2014 to start Smyte, a company that made trust and safety tools for marketplaces and social networks. Smyte was acquired by Twitter, where Pete now works on engineering problems relating to trust, safety, health, and infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pete joins the show for the first of several episodes with Facebook engineers. In these episodes, we will explore the engineering practices of Facebook&#8211;from scaling Facebook’s PHP monolith to open sourcing React and GraphQL. Other topics will include management, onboarding, and product strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our goal is to present a holistic picture of how Facebook engineering works, so that other organizations can learn to adopt practices that will allow them to move faster. We hope you enjoy this series on Facebook engineering.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software engineering is harder than it should be. There are many people who have an app idea that they are not sure how to build. Some of these people are highly technical professionals like real estate agents, scientists, and accountants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These professionals learn to use spreadsheets in their day-to-day work. Spreadsheets are also used widely by young people such as students. Spreadsheet users vary in terms of how familiar they are with the programmability of a spreadsheet, but there are certainly more people who have built complex spreadsheets than there are people who have built complex web apps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airtable is a tool for making application development easier and more accessible. The Airtable interface is similar to a spreadsheet and can be used for most spreadsheet applications. It can also serve as a rich backend database system to improve the productivity of software developers who are fully capable of building web applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are high-level programmable components called Blocks and integrations with developer APIs like Twilio and Stripe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airtable has a permissions and collaboration system that allows interaction between engineers who might be using Airtable as a programmatic transactional database and operations members who might need to read or edit specific parts of the data on an ad hoc basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Howie Liu is the CEO of Airtable and he joins the show to talk about his vision for the product and the engineering problems he is working on to realize that vision. Airtable has not been trivial to build, and has required its own custom database backend and its own JavaScript rendering system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Special thanks to </span><a href="https://garethpronovost.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gareth Pronovost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who is a full-time </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHaSwvPfNrjZ9RZy17rAhPw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airtable expert that I found on YouTube</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and who was generous enough to take some time to have a call with me and describe his experience using Airtable. The fact that there is a full profession around creating Airtable applications speaks to how unique this platform is.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relational data systems have evolved from single node instances to complex distributed systems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost any database can be accessed through a SQL statement, but the guarantees of these databases can vary in terms of consistency, availability, latency, durability, and financial cost. Relational database systems that explore these different sets of tradeoffs are sometimes categorized as “NewSQL”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also a wide variety of data systems that are not categorized as databases. Kafka is a distributed queue. HDFS is a distributed file system. Spark provides a distributed in-memory working set to process data. Cloud providers offer hosted bucket storage for your data lake and fast processing in the form of a data warehouse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunil Kamath is a principal PM with Microsoft. Sunil has worked on database systems for two decades, and he joins the show to give his perspective on the current data world and his predictions for how data platforms will become easier to use. Sunil is optimistic about the use of virtual data for unifying the access of data for a variety of operational use cases.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WebAssembly is a binary instruction format for applications to run in a memory-constrained, stack-based virtual machine. The WebAssembly ecosystem consists of tools and projects that allow programs in a variety of languages to compile into WebAssembly and run in a safe, fast, sandboxed runtime environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WebAssembly is a transformative technology for the Internet. Most users will experience it as a set of gradual, incremental improvements to their online experiences. Pages will load faster and become more dynamic. Applications will become more secure. Infrastructure will become cheaper, and those cost savings will eventually reach the consumer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For developers, WebAssembly opens a world of possibility. In today’s operating systems, the user can feel a big difference between applications that need a large client-side runtime (such as video editing tools, or render-heavy games such as Half Life) and applications that are more lightweight and can run entirely on the web (such as Twitter).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tyler McMullen is the CTO at Fastly. He joins the show to talk about the compilation path, the runtime, and the opportunities of WebAssembly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern server infrastructure usually runs in a virtualized environment. Virtual servers can exist inside of a container or inside of a virtual machine. Containers can also run on virtual machines. Kubernetes has allowed developers to manage their multiple containers, whether those containers are running in VMs or on bare metal (servers without VMs).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As organizations expand their Kubernetes deployments, the overhead of those deployments is becoming a relevant concern. So-called “Kubesprawl” can occur within organizations due to a lack of best practices on when new clusters should be spun up or spun down, and when clusters should be shared by teams or shared by services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul Czarkowski is a principal technologist with Pivotal. He joins the show to discuss virtualization, Kubernetes, and the state of the cloud native ecosystem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Satellite images contain vast quantities of data. By analyzing the contents of satellite images over time, we can identify trends in weather, soil, and agriculture. If we combine that data with ground-level sensors, we can gather a clearer understanding of how chemicals in the air or in the dirt map to how things look from above via satellite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Descartes Labs is a company that gathers high dimensional data about our planet and turns it into machine learning models to be used by customers. In order to do this, the company has built out a data pipeline involving queueing systems, machine learning frameworks, and internal tools that are used to aggregate, clean, model, and measure data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tim Kelton is a co-founder of Descartes Labs and he joins the show to discuss the high volume of data and the distributed systems that make up the Descartes Labs infrastructure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The modern software supply chain contains many different points of distribution: JavaScript frameworks, npm modules, Docker containers, open source repositories, cloud providers, on-prem firmware, IoT, networking proxies, and so much more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so much attack surface, securing a large enterprise is an uphill battle. Jeff Williams is the CTO at Contrast Security, a company that makes infrastructure monitoring tools. Contrast Security works by intercepting network traffic at a low level and assessing whether that traffic maps to a common threat model.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing a software business requires an understanding of engineering, sales, and marketing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we learn software engineering, we also pick up some knowledge about how a business should operate. We know that there are customers, and that our product needs to be scalable to serve more customers. We know that some features are more important than others, and so we focus on building the features that matter the most.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But unless we make a deliberate focus, engineers do not learn how to sell and market a software product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning how to sell and market software is an important skill to develop. It allows a software engineer to be self-sufficient. If you already know how to write software, sales and marketing are actually the only other pieces you need to be an “entrepreneur”. And the basics of sales and marketing are often easier and more fun to learn than the first painful days of learning basic programming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greg Kogan is an engineer who has shifted his focus to working as a consultant for companies that are trying to go to market with a technical product. Greg has helped grow companies such as Netlify, Scalyr, and Domino Data Lab. Much of his work is around products targeted toward developers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greg joins the show to describe his methodical approach to selling and marketing software.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Kubernetes instance occupies a wide footprint of multiple servers, creating an appealing target to an attacker, due to its access to a large pool of compute resources. A common attack against an exposed Kubernetes cluster is to take it over for the purposes of mining cryptocurrency. Thus it is important to keep a cluster secure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The importance of security is magnified for a cloud provider. A cloud provider runs a managed Kubernetes service, which might be running thousands of Kubernetes clusters. If the cloud provider’s chosen distribution of Kubernetes contains a vulnerability, or if the Kubernetes instances are misconfigured, all of these clusters could be exposed to the same vulnerability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maya Kaczorowski works on the security of Google’s managed Kubernetes service GKE. In today’s show we discuss the attack surface of a managed Kubernetes service. Maya was previously on the show to talk about container security. This episode is a good companion to that one, as well as a previous show with Liz Rice about container security.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lyft generates petabytes of data. Driver and rider behavior, pricing information, the movement of cars through space; all of this data is received by Lyft’s backend services, buffered into Kafka queues, and processed by various stream processing systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lyft moves the high volumes of data into a data lake for different users throughout the company to use offline. Machine learning jobs, batch jobs, streaming jobs and materialized databases can be created on top of that data lake. Druid and Superset are used for operational analytics and dashboarding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Li Gao is a data engineer at Lyft. He joins the show to explore the different aspects of Lyft’s data platform. We also talk about the tradeoffs of streaming frameworks, and how to manage machine learning infrastructure. This episode is a great companion to our show about Uber’s data platform, and illustrates some fundamental differences in how the two ridesharing companies operate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google’s strategy for cloud computing is centered around providing open source runtime systems and a high quality developer experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google is highly differentiated in its approach to the cloud. To understand Google’s strategy, it is useful to first set the context for the current competitive environment of cloud providers. &lt;If you want to skip straight to the interview with Eric Brewer, begin at 30:33&gt;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Web Services (AWS) popularized cloud computing in 2006. AWS was first to market, which has given the company a large competitive advantage over the rest of the industry. It took Google several years to realize how big the public cloud market was, and how good the economics of running a cloud provider could be. Microsoft also realized the opportunity several years after AWS was started.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The multi-year lead that AWS had on getting to market has given the company tremendous leverage. Because AWS is the most widely trusted, accepted default in the market, AWS is able to deepen that relationship more and more over time, despite the fact that the proprietary APIs of AWS create a level of lock-in that bears some resemblance to the lock-in of Microsoft Windows or Oracle’s relational database systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The brief history of software gives us examples of what is supposed to happen next.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a large company is operating a proprietary developer platform, the open source software ecosystem reflexively comes out with an alternative, open source solution that is better than the proprietary system, right? We saw this with the Linux project, which channeled the developer resentment of the proprietary Windows operating system software into the development of the best server operating system to date: Linux.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difference between Microsoft Windows in the 90s and AWS today is that, for the most part, developers do not resent AWS. AWS keeps its prices low, and embodies a spirit of innovation despite the fact that AWS is partly built around a repeated process of taking open source projects, packaging them up into cloud services, and integrating them closely with other AWS tools, making it harder to move away from AWS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its pioneering offerings of managed services, AWS made it easier to set up tools that had previously been impossible for less-experienced developers to operate. Distributed systems became approachable. Companies like Netflix, Lyft, and Heroku were built on the simplified operational model of AWS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AWS also innovates outside of this business model of repackaging open source projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When AWS pioneered the function-as-a-service model, they created an easy way to scale stateless computation. They presented the developer world with an entirely new compute model: event-driven programming, with services communicating to each other via functional glue code running in cheap, transient containers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is strong criticism of the event-driven, AWS Lambda-bound “serverless” compute model. And those critics make a valid point: AWS Lambda is a proprietary API.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To build your app around an event-driven architecture glued together with Lambda functions is to lock yourself tightly to Amazon infrastructure. But the critics of this model do not seem to be the ones who are actually locked in. Critics of Amazon’s proprietary strategy tend to be those with a strong incentive to be critical.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another common criticism of AWS comes from commercial open source companies such as Redis Labs and Elastic, which are vendors of the Redis open source in-memory data system, and the open source Elasticsearch search and retrieval system respectively. These vendors argue that AWS has violated the spirit of open source by repackaging open source software as profitable software and failing to contribute back to the open source ecosystem with commensurate open source contributions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AWS has repackaged both Redis and Elasticsearch as AWS Elasticache and Amazon Elasticsearch Service respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These vendors frame their relationship to AWS as zero sum, and are turning to licensing changes as their strategy of choice for creating a new defensible moat against AWS. In various Internet forums, the indignant commercial open source software vendors and AWS have both made their cases to the developer community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a developer who just wants to build your software, these arguments are an unsettling distraction. In addition to worrying about fault tolerance and durability guarantees and cost management, you now have to worry about licensing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as you observe these circumstances, with open source vendors accusing cloud providers of improper behavior, you might begin to wonder: what actually are the rules of open source? By what set of commandments are we judging who is good and who is bad?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And who is to judge what is fair or unfair activity by Amazon, which was the first company to prove to all of us just how influential cloud computing could be?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the competitive landscape of the cloud circa April 2019, when I attended Google Cloud Next, Google’s annual cloud developer conference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the conference, the optimism and playful spirit of Google was present everywhere. There were colorful shapes and cartoonish diagrams that looked like building blocks made for children. In the expo hall, there were food pillars from which free candy and salted snacks could be grabbed all day long.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On one side of the expo hall, a demonstration from IKEA showed how the company was partnering with Google to run its furniture business more like a software company. Stretching across the expo hall in a carpeted distance of multiple football fields, the various vendors showed off their latest wares in a bazaar of multicloud, hybrid cloud, and Kubernetes-compliant sales pitches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last decade, large enterprises have opened up their wallets more and more, realizing just how valuable cloud infrastructure can be for their businesses. The more they spend, the more efficient their workers become, and the faster their businesses can improve. For modern enterprise, the cloud is the closest thing to magic that we have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowledge workers are becoming unshackled from the painful, slow pace of early technological corporatism. The cloud can empower all of us&#8211;and rather than replacing our jobs with machines, the cloud will allow us to better express our humanity within our work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The twin forces of consumer mobile computing on the client side and cloud computing on the server side are compounding faster than we can measure. Five years ago, a common analogy was to compare the smartphone to a “remote control for your life”. Today the smartphone feels more like a magic wand than a remote control. We can summon tremendous forces from the magical cloud by merely speaking the right command into our wand-like smartphone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someday even the world of Harry Potter may look antiquated relative to our reality. Why carry around a wand when you can use your Airpods to cast your spells via hands-free voice command?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cloud&#8217;s magical effects on corporate enterprise operations are exciting to watch.</span><a href="https://jeffmeyerson.com/the-expo-hall-track"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I go to a lot of conferences, and I prefer to walk around the expo hall rather than to go to any sessions.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> At the expo hall, you see the distance between vendor hype and the realities of the enterprise. From my vantage point, that distance gets shorter every year: enterprises truly are adopting DevOps, continuous delivery, machine learning, and data platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From insurance companies to banks to farming companies to furniture outlets: the “digital transformation” is actually happening. This is great for consumers, and great for employees at the large corporations that are being digitally transformed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is it like to work at a large, 100 year old enterprise that is going through digital transformation? It is certainly much more appealing than it was a decade ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The servile, bureaucratic, rent-seeking hierarchies of the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s are slowly being refurbished into enterprises where bottoms-up innovation, individualism, and artistic energy are assets rather than liabilities. We are moving out of the age of boring cubicle industrialism towards a vision in which work is truly creative and fulfilling for every member of the corporation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Google evangelizes this ideal stronger than any other company in the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the tremendous cash flows from its advertising business, Google reinvests heavily into its employee base. Many employees at Google have worked there for a decade and show no intention of leaving, having found a job, but more importantly a culture and an engineering environment that is unrivaled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking subjectively: my sense is that Google’s internal engineering tools are the best in the world. For many years, Google has been the strongest magnet for talent in the realm of Internet infrastructure and machine learning. In terms of sophistication, the rest of the software industry has been playing catch-up to Google since the days of the MapReduce paper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of the MapReduce paper: even back in 2004, Google was willing to share its findings with the outside world. Google was tactical about which innovations it would open up about, but it does seem that Google has truly tried to embody some of the publishing philosophies of academia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google’s early investments in an academic-like environment have borne considerable fruit. The curiosity and cross-institutional collaboration enabled by Google’s willingness to speak openly about its research have made Google a refuge for academics, including today’s guest Eric Brewer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond its considerable contributions as a publisher of computer science theory, Google has also become the model software engineering practitioner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google has scaled its internal tools to make its thousands of developers highly productive. Given its success with its internal developers, it should come as no surprise that Google has strong opinions about the best way to build services for external developers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have often wondered what it is actually like to work within Google as an engineer. I have worked at Amazon, and seen their internal tooling. At Amazon, the level of tooling gave engineers tremendous leverage. But from talking to more experienced engineers, my sense is that nobody holds a candle to the internal tools of Google.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.softwaredaily.com/post/5cb6efdd0e4713000c0f6e16/Drishti-Deep-Learning-for-Manufacturing-with-Krish-Chaudhury"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drishti CTO Krish Chaudhury was a recent guest on this podcast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He spent nearly a decade at Google working on computer vision projects. Today he is building his own computer vision company. When I asked him if we yet had “Google Infrastructure for Everyone”, he sighed deeply and wistfully before answering with an unequivocal “no”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This hints at what Google wants to do with its cloud. Google does not think of Google Cloud as commodity cloud computing services. The vision for Google Cloud is to be the premier cloud, the deluxe set of services and hardware that provides “Google Infrastructure For Everyone”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a moonshot, and in order to accomplish it, Google will need to forego certain short term opportunities for cash grabs. But it is undoubtedly a more fiscally wise strategy for Google to optimize growth of the 2029 Q3 cloud market rather than that of 2019 Q3.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a conglomerate standpoint, Google already has a cash cow. Google has won today’s war, and it only makes sense to focus on tomorrow’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Google’s approach to the cloud, we see a cultural distinction between Amazon and Google. The cultures of Amazon and Google are partly deliberate, but partly driven by the nature of their businesses’ respective revenue streams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon built its e-commerce business in a low-margin, highly competitive environment. Amazon won its customers over through a slow process of building trust. In its delivery of physical goods, Amazon formed close relationships with customers. Amazon would repeatedly listen to these customers and use that feedback to improve their products. This “flywheel” of iterative improvement is the core engine that keeps Amazon improving incrementally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon also has made far-flung, ambitious investments&#8211;but the size and scope of Amazon’s moonshots were constrained for many years by its lack of any singularly large cash cow. Fire Phone notwithstanding, Amazon’s moonshots have often been thrifty asymmetric bets, requiring minimal upfront investment but presenting huge potential payoff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google, on the other hand, has been in a much more luxurious financial position for most of its life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google has a high margin advertising business that accounts for ~84% of its revenues, subsidizing everything else in Google (and Alphabet). Because it has such a big cash cow in a totally different area of the business, Google can afford to take an extremely long-term approach to its vision for the cloud. For Google, the goal is not to maximize the profit margins of the cloud over the next two years. Google can afford to think of cloud profitability in the increment of decades.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the business of cloud computing, Google has turned the weakness of being a late mover into a wide set of strengths.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AWS console presents its users with a sprawling array of possibilities. Google Cloud has a lower surface area. Google is more opinionated about the right way to do things&#8211;and it is easier for Google to build in an opinionated fashion because there are fewer legacy customers and edge cases to support. AWS supports the majority of the market, so it is in a position where it must keep those customers happy in order to hold onto its moat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what are Google’s strong opinions about the way that a cloud should operate?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google’s espoused vision is that of the “open cloud”: a cloud environment where organizations could easily move workloads from one cloud provider to another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we take the purest, most aspirational interpretation of “open cloud”, the full stack would be open source. Identity and access management systems would be portable as well, and cloud providers would work together to reduce the switching costs between each other, even in cases of data gravity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As virtuous as the idea of the “open cloud” sounds, it is also strategically convenient for Google. Since it lags behind Amazon and Microsoft in terms of adoption, a gradual shift towards a widely standardized open cloud would theoretically make it easier for Google to recover market share as the cloud market matures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever Google’s true motives are, the “open cloud” strategy has been tremendously bountiful to the developer community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By open sourcing Kubernetes and pouring resources into it, Google brought an end to the painful, wasteful container orchestration wars. In its donation of Kubernetes to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (which it also is a heavy financial donor to), Google created an ostensibly open, positive sum environment for the rivaling cloud providers to congregate productively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the area of machine learning, Google open sourced TensorFlow and invested heavily into tutorials, documentation, YouTube videos, and other resources. Google built JavaScript libraries and auditability and visualization tools. Google has marshalled an entire ecosystem around TensorFlow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of Google’s commercial open source efforts have had less favorable results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Istio service mesh project seems to have been promoted with the same playbook that Kubernetes and TensorFlow followed, but with a less usable tool. In Istio, we see Google’s expertise in marketing perhaps taken too far.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is Istio a problematic case study?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because, despite the fact that there are multiple</span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/12/19/linkerd-service-mesh-with-william-morgan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> open</span></a> <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2019/04/11/consul-service-mesh-with-paul-banks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">source</span></a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">service</span></a> <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2019/01/04/kong-api-platform-with-marco-palladino/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mesh</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> products on the market with significant production usage, Istio has managed to make so much noise about itself that it is convincing the market that the battle for service mesh superiority is a foregone conclusion&#8211;in spite of widespread reports that Istio is currently difficult to operate and not ready for production workloads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the blog posts, to the KubeCon programming to the expo hall hype, the cloud native developer community has been hammered with the same messaging about service mesh: Istio is the best, don’t bother with the rest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps Google is just doing us all a favor with Istio. Maybe it really will be the best service mesh, it&#8217;s just not quite there yet. Maybe Google is just ironing out the kinks, and the marketing roadmap happened to proceed at a faster pace than the engineering roadmap. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or maybe I have been talking too much to the other service mesh companies. Honestly I don’t really know how these meshes trade off against each other, though I have certainly asked previous guests for comparisons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it&#8217;s so early in the huge space that has been bucketed within the category of “service mesh” that maybe Google is acting with best intentions and trying to get out ahead of another container orchestration war.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking as a developer who prefers to work on application abstractions far above the world of security policy and load balancing and canarying, I would personally be fine with Google running it&#8217;s open source marketing playbook with Istio, winning everyone over, and saving our energy for more productive deliberations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am fine with Google picking winners where it deems such actions appropriate. But this gets at a tension of the “open cloud”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What kind of openness are we really talking about here? If I can&#8217;t see the strategic roadmap of Google Cloud or the backroom conversations, is it still open? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the open source repos remain in Google&#8217;s control, is that open source, or marketing? When Google tinkers with an operating system like Fuscia in the open, but we are left to speculate as to why they are working on it, or what purpose it serves, is that open source or marketing?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Google is such an open cloud, why not open source a detailed ten year strategic roadmap, and pass the buck to Amazon to do the same? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In any case, I’m not passing judgment on whether Google has done something morally wrong by pushing Istio so hard. I just think it was strategically unwise. With Istio, Google made it a little too obvious just how much narrative control it has over the public developer market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps this narrative control should come as no surprise. Of all the major clouds, Google is the most well-versed in open source. From its contributions to Linux to its maintenance of a complicated Android ecosystem, Google knows how to play its cards in the game of open source diplomacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In battle, a classic strategy for competing with a rival that has an advantage is to force that rival onto territory that you are more familiar with. There are many historical cases where a small army was able to defeat a large army due to its ability to maneuver the battle front to a favorable environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through its open cloud strategy, this is exactly what Google is doing. Google is open sourcing the best way that it knows how to build and run infrastructure software. This is happening slowly but steadily. To some extent, the other major providers including Amazon will have no choice but to follow Google into a battleground that was built by Google.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as developers, we will get to reap all the rewards of this competition. Our infrastructure will become more standardized, more fault tolerant, cheaper, better designed, and easier to use. And who knows, maybe someday we will actually be able to easily move workloads from one cloud to another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the extent that I am a software engineering journalist, I feel inclined to scrutinize all of the cloud providers. But to the extent that I am an engineer and a business person, I feel only admiration and love for the cloud providers. Cloud computing has brought the cost of starting an Internet business down to zero.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud computing has opened up my eyes to a world of creative possibilities that knows no boundaries, and for that I will always be a fan of all of the rivaling cloud companies because they all have played a role in creating the current software landscape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric Brewer is a Google Fellow and VP Infrastructure. </span><a href="http://www.se-radio.net/2015/05/the-cap-theorem-then-and-now/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is well-known for his work on the CAP theorem, a distributed systems concept that formalized the tradeoffs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance in a distributed system.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Google, Eric is as much a strategist and product creator as he is a theoretician. He has worked on database systems such as Spanner, machine learning systems such as TensorFlow, and container orchestration systems such as Kubernetes and GKE.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric joins the show to talk about Google’s philosophy as a cloud provider, and how his understanding of distributed systems has evolved since joining the company.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intricately is a company that maps the breadth and depth of cloud infrastructure usage. Using a combination of clever algorithms, data engineering, and web crawlers, Intricately derives information about how different companies spend money on infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fima Leshinsky is the CEO and co-founder at Intricately. In his previous job at Akamai, he began to study how a cloud provider such as Akamai could figure out how much its competitors were charging certain customers. Since CDN infrastructure is a commodity with reasonably low switching cost, a provider that can undercut its competitors significantly can have an edge in the marketplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From his work at Akamai, Fima felt there was a market opportunity to provide this kind of service to the broader market of cloud providers. There are more cloud providers than ever before, and the kind of data that Intricately aggregates is highly useful to this competitive marketplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fima joins the show to talk about the modern landscape of cloud providers, and how to build a system that maps the Internet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Linux operating system includes user space and kernel space. In user space, the user can create and interact with a variety of applications directly. In kernel space, the Linux kernel provides a stable environment in which device drivers interact with hardware and manage low level resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Linux container is a virtualized environment that runs within user space.  To perform an operation, a process in a container in user space makes a syscall (system call) into kernel space. This allows the container to have access to resources like memory and disk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kernel space must be kept secure to ensure operating system integrity&#8211;but Linux includes hundreds of syscalls. Each syscall represents an interface between the user space and kernel space. Security vulnerabilities can emerge from this wide attack surface of different syscalls, and most applications only need a small number of syscalls to perform their required functionality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">gVisor is a project to restrict the number of syscalls that the kernel and user space need to communicate. gVisor is a runtime layer between the user space container and the kernel space. gVisor reduces the number of syscalls that can be made into kernel space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The security properties of gVisor make it an exciting project today&#8211;but it is the portability features of gVisor that hint at a huge future opportunity. By inserting an interpreter interface between containers and the Linux kernel, gVisor presents the container world with the opportunity to run on operating systems other than Linux.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many reasons why it might be appealing to run containers on an operating system other than Linux. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Linux was built many years ago, before the explosion of small devices, smart phones, IoT hubs, voice assistants and smart cars. To be more speculative, Google is working on a secretive new operating system called Fuscia. gVisor could be a layer that allows workloads to be ported from Linux servers to Fuscia servers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yoshi Tamura is a product manager at Google with a background in containers and virtualization. He joins the show to talk about gVisor and the different kinds of virtualization.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Twilio is used for 2-factor authentication and text message relaying, Twilio is critical infrastructure for most applications that implement it. The service must remain highly available even in times of peak application traffic, or outages at a particular cloud provider.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he was at Twilio, James Burns worked on platform infrastructure and observability. James was at Twilio from 2014 to 2017, a time in which the company experienced rapid scalability. His work encompassed site reliability, monitoring, cost management and incident response. He also led chaos engineering exercises called “game days”, in which the company deliberately caused infrastructure to fail in order to ensure the reliability of failover systems and to discover problematic dependencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James joins the show to talk about his time at Twilio and his perspectives on how to instrument and observe complex applications. Full disclosure: James now works at LightStep, which is a sponsor of Software Engineering Daily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google’s options for running serverless workloads started with App Engine. App Engine is a way to deploy an application in a fully managed environment. Since the early days of App Engine, managed infrastructure has matured and become more granular.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We now have serverless databases, queueing systems, machine learning tools, and functions as a service. Developers can create fully managed, event-driven, highly scalable systems with less code and less operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different cloud providers are taking different approaches to offering serverless runtimes. Google’s approach involves the open source Knative project and a hosted platform for running Knative workloads called Cloud Run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steren Giannini is a product manager at Google working on serverless tools. He joins the show to discuss Google’s serverless projects and the implementation details in building them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Products are an art form. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with any art, the world of products includes creators, patrons, fans, business people, and investors. </span><a href="http://producthunt.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product Hunt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a place where those different people connect to build and discuss products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Products are different from other art forms in that they are measured not only through the lens of design and beauty&#8211;but also through utility. From software to books to couches to toiletry&#8211;we all have products that have improved our lives so much that we feel a deep sense of connection and hope for that product and the people behind it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan Hoover is the founder of Product Hunt, a product I have found tremendous value and satisfaction from over the years. He is also a host of </span><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/radio"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product Hunt Radio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a weekly podcast with the people creating and exploring the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan joins the show to discuss products, the process of creating something useful, and his investing strategy. Ryan runs the </span><a href="https://weekend.fund/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weekend Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an early stage investment fund. </span></p>

<p><a href="https://findcollabs.com/project/TQQCLSL2KYLq9jS7gxBq"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software Daily is looking for help with Android engineering, QA, machine learning, and more</span></a></p>
<p><a href="http://findcollabs.com/hackathon"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FindCollabs Hackathon has ended&#8211;winners will probably be announced by the time this episode airs; we will be announcing our next hackathon in a few weeks, so stay tuned</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open source policy has become a business issue as well as a political one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses like Elastic, MongoDB (the company), and Redis Labs have started to view the open source licenses of the projects they work on as a means for business defensibility against cloud providers offering similar services. It remains to be seen how viable this strategy will be for the commercial open source vendors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies that do not directly sell commercial open source are also grappling with questions around open source licensing. Facebook has become a force in the open source world through projects like React and GraphQL. Facebook leads these projects, but Facebook is not monetizing them other than to the extent that they use the projects to build Facebook.com. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook’s incentives are aligned with the rest of the industry on the quality of the GraphQL and React projects. Proper licensing can help Facebook keep those incentives in alignment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel Marcey, Michael Cheng, and Kathy Kam from Facebook join me for a discussion of the state of open source licensing, and how that impacts Facebook.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drishti is a company focused on improving manufacturing workflows using computer vision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A manufacturing environment consists of assembly lines. A line is composed of sequential stations along that manufacturing line. At each station on the assembly line, a worker performs an operation on the item that is being manufactured. This type of workflow is used for the manufacturing of cars, laptops, stereo equipment, and many other technology products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Drishti, the manufacturing process is augmented by adding a camera at each station. Camera footage is used to train a machine learning model for each station on the assembly line. That machine learning model is used to ensure the accuracy and performance of each task that is being conducted on the assembly line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krish Chaudhury is the CTO at Drishti. From 2005 to 2015 he led image processing and computer vision projects at Google before joining Flipkart, where he worked on image science and deep learning for another four years. Krish had spent more than twenty years working on image and vision related problems when he co-founded Drishti.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s episode, we discuss the science and application of computer vision, as well as the future of manufacturing technology and the business strategy of Drishti.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lyft is a ridesharing company with petabytes of data. Within Lyft, many different employees can use those data sets to build useful applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A business analyst creates a dashboard to see how driver satisfaction is changing over time. An economist studies the pricing data to ensure that Lyft’s prices are competitive. A data scientist creates a report of how the speed of a ride correlates with 5 star ratings. A machine learning engineer trains a model to detect fraud on the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these use cases make sense&#8211;and in each of them, the employee at Lyft needs to find the necessary data sets within the company to build their application. Amundsen is a tool for finding and discovering data sets within the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tao Feng and Mark Grover are engineers at Lyft and join the show to talk about the problem of data discovery and the tools they have built at Lyft.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until Google DeepMind came into the field, protein structure prediction was dominated by academics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protein structure prediction is the process of predicting how a protein will fold by looking at genetic code. Protein structure prediction is a perfect field to approach through the application of deep learning, because the inputs are highly dimensional and there is a plentiful array of different sets of labeled data. Protein structure deep learning is a field in which many different approaches are taken, often involving supervised learning and reinforcement learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mohammed Al Quraishi is a systems biologist at Harvard. His background spans computer engineering, statistics, and genetics. In his work, Mohammed explores the interplay between biology and computer systems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One area of Mohammed’s focus is protein structure prediction. </span><a href="https://moalquraishi.wordpress.com/2018/12/09/alphafold-casp13-what-just-happened/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a blog post last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Mohammed gave a brief history of protein structure prediction and described the significance of DeepMind entering the field. DeepMind’s AlphaFold technology surpassed all other competitors in the most recent CASP protein structure competition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mohammed joins the show to discuss biology, academia, deep learning, and DeepMind.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="8cc8" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3 graf--subtitle"><a href="http://podsheets.com">Podsheets</a> is a set of <a href="https://github.com/crablar/podsheets">open source tools</a> for podcast hosting, publishing, ad management, community engagement, and more.</h2>
<div class="uiScale uiScale-ui--regular uiScale-caption--regular u-flexCenter u-marginVertical24 u-fontSize15 js-postMetaLockup">
<div class="u-flex0">
<p id="f2d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Podsheets is influenced by our experience managing Software Engineering Daily, a full-time podcast business.</p>
<p id="346f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Software Engineering Daily is a podcast that airs 5 times per week. With 4 ads per show and 50 business weeks per year, we have 1000 podcast ads that we manage per year. Podcast ad sales is an inefficient market, and the tooling around managing ads for the individual podcaster is poor.</p>
<p id="95e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Difficulties in the podcast ecosystem also exist for new podcasters. It is still very confusing to get started as a podcaster. Podcasting should be as easy as blogging but remains far from it.</p>
<p id="f054" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Podsheets serves the use cases of all podcasters — from beginners to full-time professionals.</p>
<p id="68b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In this document, we outline the landscape of podcasting. We describe the major corporate players, the workflow of a podcaster, and the mechanics of running a podcast business.</p>
<p id="09d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Next, we present Podsheets, a set of open source tools for podcasters.</p>
<p id="30c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally, we give our predictions for how the media landscape will shift in the coming years, creating a need for more open source media publishing tools.</p>
<h3 id="bc2f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The State of Podcasting</h3>
<p id="6c94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Podcasting has been having a renaissance over the last five years.</p>
<p id="4432" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 2014, the launch of Serial coincided with improvements to cellular bandwidth in the US. It was now possible to stream podcasts from your phone easily and cheaply. There was great content to listen to, and the improved infrastructure made it listenable.</p>
<p id="4591" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Still, podcasting remained in a fractured stalemate for five years after the launch of Serial. This was due to the fact that Apple had first-mover advantage as the dominant podcast index, but Apple opted not to capitalize on that fact. This is understandable, as Apple’s core competency is futuristic hardware, and its resources are allocated to business lines such as self-driving cars and augmented reality glasses.</p>
<p id="6cb3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 2019, Spotify acquired Gimlet (a source of premium podcast content) and Anchor (the most popular, simplest podcast host). <span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="81463f02d1da">Spotify is making a play at consolidating the market of podcasting. Spotify has a clear path to becoming the “YouTube of podcasts”, which we should all celebrate as a long time coming.</span></p>
<p id="b008" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the same time, we recognize the hunger for decentralized media platforms. The centralization of video content within YouTube has driven conspiracy theory, ad fraud, and other problems that are difficult for a centralized player to solve. These problems manifest for text as well, and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has spoken enthusiastically about the potential for blockchain technology to improve trust for applications such as Twitter.</p>
<p id="1e16" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Podcasts have suffered and benefited from the lack of centralization. As the podcast world swings towards a centralized marketplace, there is a need for a countermovement towards open, decentralized infrastructure.</p>
<h3 id="3281" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Players</h3>
<p id="131b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Below is an overview of the types of players in the podcasting ecosystem.</p>
<p id="a759" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today’s ecosystem is fragmented and messy. The line between podcast networks, ad agencies, and production studios is blurry.</p>
<h4 id="78c6" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Podcasters</h4>
<p id="03a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Individual podcasters range from small, unmonetized podcasts to individuals with millions of listeners.</p>
<p id="9ef4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The staff for an individual podcaster may include ad sales, editing, scheduling, and technical operations such as website management. The individual podcaster might hire these people on full- or part-time basis.</p>
<p id="2bf7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To sell ads, a podcaster often works with a podcast ad agency. The podcaster might join a podcast network to consolidate inventory with other podcasters.</p>
<p id="4ca1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some podcasts, such as Software Engineering Daily, manage all their ad sales in-house. This requires demanding sales activities such as prospecting, account management, close management, and client services.</p>
<h4 id="1dc6" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Podcast Production Studios</h4>
<p id="9b58" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">NPR, Gimlet, and Vox Media are examples of podcast production studios. These companies own physical studio space to produce high quality audio content on a regular basis.</p>
<h4 id="14f5" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Podcast Networks</h4>
<p id="3e6d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Earwolf, Nerdist, and Podcast One are examples of podcast networks. A podcast network combines the inventory available across multiple podcasts in order to sell more efficiently to advertisers.</p>
<h4 id="d77d" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Spotify</h4>
<p id="7ae2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Spotify is perfectly positioned to become the YouTube of podcasts.</p>
<p id="887a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With its acquisition of Anchor, Spotify has a real chance at capturing the creation, distribution, hosting, and automated monetization of podcasts.</p>
<p id="bd01" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With its acquisition of Gimlet Media, Spotify gains high quality content, established production processes, and sales teams. Gimlet was co-founded by Alex Blumberg, whose roots in NPR give Spotify knowledge of the entire history of the modern audio space.</p>
<h4 id="d96b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Apple</h4>
<p id="0564" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Apple maintains the central index of podcasts.</p>
<p id="7cee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Other podcast indexes are usually built by scraping Apple. Compared to its available resources, Apple has invested almost nothing into podcasting over the last five years. Its biggest milestone is a detailed analytics tool that lets podcasters see detailed data on when users are dropping off from podcasts.</p>
<p id="00d9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Apple Podcast Analytics is a seemingly simple tool, but not trivially easy to build and deploy. It could be a bellwether for more vigorous technical investments.</p>
<p id="4aff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In any case, Apple could have acted sooner. Apple could have poured money into podcasting at any point in the last 5 years. Why hasn’t Apple become the Spotify of podcasts?</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li id="7e5d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Apple could be apathetic about podcasts.</strong> When you are managing the iPhone supply chain and building self-driving cars, it’s hard to care about mp3 files and RSS feeds.</li>
<li id="57a6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Apple could be enthusiastic about the fractured state of the ecosystem.</strong> Apple is a subtly rebellious company, and podcasts are perhaps the most rebellious content medium today.</li>
<li id="7b31" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Apple could be marshalling the troops for its own grab at the YouTube of podcasts.</strong> Apple is easing into high-quality original content production for TV. If Apple has a desire to expand into a multimedia network, it has that option.</li>
</ul>
<p id="0679" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="81463f02d1da">Apple has been historically willing to pursue last-mover advantage.</span> Perhaps we will see more investment in podcasting from Apple in the near future.</p>
<h4 id="4a4a" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">YouTube</h4>
<p id="9e07" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">YouTube is relevant because searching for individual podcast episodes is currently immature.</p>
<p id="3926" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As an example, try searching Google for podcasts where Seth Godin talks about his childhood. Seth Godin has been on many podcasts, and has written many blogs. It is easy to find the blogs where he talks about his childhood. But the podcasts are much harder.</p>
<p id="f1ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Many podcasts are not transcribed, so there is not a good index of what is said on that podcast episode — unless someone proactively transcribes the audio. YouTube automatically transcribes the videos that are uploaded. This allows YouTube to offer contextual ads as well as closed captioning.</p>
<p id="598a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In order to get your podcast on YouTube, you need to convert each audio file into a video and upload it to YouTube. Most podcasters don’t want to bother with this.</p>
<p id="14ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To summarize: YouTube has the best search engine for individual podcast episodes — except that many podcasts are not on YouTube.</p>
<p id="da26" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you are not a YouTube Red subscriber, your video will stop playing when you lock the screen on your phone. In order to exclusively <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">listen</em> to a YouTube video, you need to be a YouTube Red subscriber.</p>
<h4 id="bb12" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Podcast Ad Agencies</h4>
<p id="18f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Individual podcasters who do not want to sell ads but do want to have advertisements can enlist the help of a podcast ad agency. The biggest advertisers in the podcast space (Squarespace, Audible, ZipRecruiter, etc) purchase inventory through these agencies.</p>
<p id="3671" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Agencies have huge informational advantage because they see both sides of the market in real time. They see the volume of inventory in different podcast segments, CPMs, CPCs, and CLTVs.</p>
<p id="e3c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The big ad agencies are viciously exploitative of their leverage over podcasters. The perversions of podcast ad sales are beyond the scope of this document. But it is important to note that podcast agency ad sales is an inefficient market.</p>
<p id="b66d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Regarding ad sales, consolidation towards Spotify is a coin flip — it could make things worse for podcasters or could make things better.</p>
<p id="aacf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Podcasters should have a viable option for managing their own ad inventory.</strong></p>
<p id="71bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This explains the eponymous “sheet” in Podsheets. Software Engineering Daily (and many other podcasts) maintains a detailed spreadsheet for managing inventory.</p>
<p id="1be9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We’ll discuss the importance of the podcast spreadsheet, and our vision for podcast production and ads management later in the document.</p>
<h4 id="b666" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Other Players</h4>
<p id="9925" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Google Podcasts, Overcast, Pandora, Libsyn, and other products in the space also represent important facets of this ecosystem. The above list of players is not comprehensive.</p>
<h3 id="9f1d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Influencer Marketing Predicts The Future Of Podcast Marketing</h3>
<p id="2827" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The best podcast ads are personal testimonials that are spliced into the episodes.</p>
<p id="6d90" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Podcast ads are a form of influencer marketing. This is in stark contrast to the world of TV commercials, which are produced wholly by the product companies themselves.</p>
<p id="4dcf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Influencer marketing has not consolidated into automated auctions in the way that advertising platforms like Facebook and Google ads have consolidated. Influencer marketing has matured into a fractured, inefficient ecosystem that bears many similarities to the podcast ecosystem.</p>
<p id="e6e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We can look at the social media influencer marketing space as a leading indicator of where the podcast market is headed, and a few points are worth considering:</p>
<ol class="postList">
<li id="3996" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Influencer marketing agencies take an enormous cut from both the advertisers and the influencers.</li>
<li id="2378" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Influencers who have been in business for a few years realize they can make more money (and better sponsored content) if they deal directly with brands.</li>
<li id="9f11" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">As influencers have become more savvy, the market for influencer SaaS tools has expanded to serve the needs of influencers. These SaaS tools let an influencer operate like a personalized multimedia platform without the need for agency middlemen.</li>
</ol>
<p id="cc6b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">As of March 2019, the influencer ecosystem is evolving even further, with adoption of technologies such as Patreon and Discord.</p>
<h3 id="2a6c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">How To Manage A Podcast With Ads</h3>
<p id="75ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Software Engineering Daily has 5 shows per week, 4 ads per show, 50 weeks per year, for a total of 1000 podcast ads. We manage our ad inventory and show production process in a spreadsheet, which is shown below.</p>

<p id="8a56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">As we sell podcast ads, we schedule them onto episodes in our upcoming show calendar. Our inventory (on the right) is updated as we schedule ads (on the left).</p>
<p id="642f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here is a list of complexities we deal with related to advertising:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li id="1fa1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Prospecting: </strong>how do we find potential companies who want to buy our ads?</li>
<li id="fd93" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Lead management:</strong> how do we work a prospect through the sales process and eventually close a deal?</li>
<li id="8c1e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Close management:</strong> once a deal is closing, how do we issue the contract?</li>
<li id="cb65" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Accounting: </strong>how do we issue invoices and get paid?</li>
<li id="f0ca" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Transparency: </strong>how does an advertiser know that we are airing our ads when we say we will?</li>
<li id="ed9b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Reporting: </strong>how do we communicate statistics around our ads and episodes?</li>
<li id="e634" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Account management:</strong> how do we retain an advertiser and keep them happy?</li>
<li id="462e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Ad scheduling:</strong> how does an advertiser pick which episodes to air their ads on?</li>
<li id="f4dc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Ad insertion: </strong>how do we communicate to our podcast editor which ads to insert and at what timestamps?</li>
</ul>
<p id="9d8d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">We address these complexities through a combination of spreadsheets, emails, CRMs, accounting tools, Slack workflows, and contractors. With Podsheets, we hope to consolidate much of this work into a single technology.</p>
<p id="2cf1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">We do not expect to replace everything — but we have a clear vision for a set of tools that are custom built for podcasters to manage their media businesses.</strong></p>
<p id="e916" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At Software Engineering Daily, we work hard to sell our podcast ad inventory. But we are sacrificing a lot of value because we are struggling with our tooling, and struggling with an undeveloped advertising ecosystem.</p>
<p id="c0af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When we splice in podcast ads, that podcast ad is usually going to be in the podcast audio for the lifetime of the podcast. At Software Engineering Daily, we do not use “dynamic insertion”. But we would like to.</p>
<p id="7712" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Dynamic insertion allows podcasters to easily change the ads that are spliced into their podcast episodes. Dynamic insertion can mean two things:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li id="94c5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">A podcaster manually changes the ads that are spliced into an episode. </strong>Example: podcaster releases episode X on January 3rd. 6 months later, podcaster changes the ads which are spliced into that episode. This can be useful for podcasts with “evergreen” content.</li>
<li id="5a56" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Podcast ads are inserted on-the-fly based on the persona of the listener. </strong>Example: you listen to 4 episodes of Software Engineering Daily in a row about Bitcoin. Then you start listening to an episode about JavaScript. When you load this episode, we insert an ad for a Bitcoin-related product just before you start listening.</li>
</ul>
<p id="8b89" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Dynamic insertion is an important consideration for the future of podcasting, as we explain later in this post.</p>
<h3 id="5b73" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Podcast Surveillance</h3>
<p id="7b2f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Before we discuss Podsheets, one more point around the downsides of podcast market consolidation towards platforms like Spotify and YouTube.</p>
<p id="d3b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When you listen to a podcast on a naive podcast player, there is usually not a system monitoring what words you are hearing. In its most basic form, a podcast player is a dumb mp3 player reading from dumb RSS infrastructure.</p>
<p id="5425" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Many podcast consumers like things this way. Podcast feels distinctly like radio or old school television. When you listen to a podcast about topic X on a dumb podcast player, you do not immediately start seeing display ads around the Internet for X.</p>
<p id="3406" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s understand why this is the case.</p>
<p id="cdb3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There is no transcript that has been aligned with timestamps in the audio. Because of this, there can be no natural language processing over this stream of audio. You cannot see improved search results, ad targeting, or content recommendations based on the content you listen to.</p>
<p id="58f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Depending on who you are, this is a benefit or a disadvantage. As blockchain technology improves, the Internet will offer a more granular range of surveillant media outlets. Some people will choose surveillance + convenience, other people will choose privacy.</p>
<p id="4f3c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Until we have blockchain-powered media, podcasting remains one of the few bastions of semi-private media consumption.</p>
<p id="2ca9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today, podcasting is not surveillant because the infrastructure is immature. Transcription and audio alignment powered by deep learning remains expensive. As these costs drop, podcasting will become increasingly surveilled.</p>
<p id="9e74" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today’s podcast infrastructure is decentralized, and not heavily surveilled. Market consolidation into companies like Spotify and YouTube will increase that surveillance.</p>
<h3 id="66d9" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Podsheets</h3>
<p id="9bbb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Podsheets is an open source platform for podcasters.</p>
<p id="25c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Podsheets will allow a podcaster to accomplish the following:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li id="5578" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Host their podcast’s audio files, website content, and RSS feed on a backing storage medium of their choice</li>
<li id="fa34" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Manage the audio files to do updates in their ads and other dynamic insertions</li>
<li id="eea6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Manage ad inventory and communicate that inventory to potential advertising customers</li>
<li id="562e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Allow for a podcaster to offer subscriptions or donations</li>
<li id="eded" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Give every podcast its own social network for its listeners</li>
</ul>
<p id="6ddf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">We believe the following about our users:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li id="f822" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Podsheets should feel like a simple, vertical solution for a nontechnical podcaster</li>
<li id="72a2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Podsheets should feel like a modular toolset for a technical podcaster</li>

<p id="6418" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Our design is minimalistic because podcasting is a minimalistic system. A podcast hosting tool is simply an interface for publishing and editing an RSS feed of text and audio files.</p>

<p id="cc01" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To build Podsheets, we need help from many types of people: designers, writers, engineers, podcasters, podcast listeners, and QA testers.

<h3 id="b539" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Spreadsheets: The Ultimate Tool For Media Planning</h3>
<p id="0f51" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Advertising is how most podcasters make their living.</p>
<p id="eb07" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Paid subscriptions and donations are also important to the podcasting ecosystem, and we will explore those monetization options later in the post. This section is about the tooling that Podsheets will offer for advertising-based podcasters.</p>
<p id="5c78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Advertising allows podcasters to run their own media company. One beauty of podcast advertising is that it can connect small audiences with products that those audiences have a genuine need for. Podcasters can find advertisers that do not compromise their views.</p>
<p id="345f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Podcasters need a way to manage their own ad inventory. </strong>Without the option to self-manage, podcasters will turn to centralized solutions such as Spotify and media agencies.</p>
<p id="3a0c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why the name “Podsheets”?</p>
<p id="0c31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We believe that managing the ad inventory of a podcast is best handled by a dynamic spreadsheet view that would allow podcasters to change their scheduled ads by simply changing a row in a spreadsheet-like view.</p>
<p id="ad0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Advertising is central to the life of a podcaster. A podcaster needs to find ad deals and manage the production of their advertising content. The advertising needs to be harmonious with the podcast content.</p>
<p id="9be0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Many podcasters are solo entrepreneurs. They do not have employees. They are doing <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">everything</em> themselves. A dynamic spreadsheet allows a podcaster to manage the podcast along with their advertising.</p>
<p id="48f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Our perspective on the importance of the podcast spreadsheet comes from personal experience of running Software Engineering Daily. We have scheduled roughly 3000 ads across all of our episodes.</p>
<p id="2ec5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s revisit the spreadsheet we use to plan our podcast episode calendar.</p>

<h3 id="bcfe" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Podcasters Need Dynamic Insertion</h3>
<p id="7494" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Podsheets will allow the spreadsheet view to be tied to the current state of a given podcast episode.</p>
<p id="3daa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This will enable easy dynamic podcast ad management. It also gives a place for podcast editors, hosts, producers, and operations members to collaborate.</p>
<p id="e077" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Self-managed, dynamic ad insertion allows a podcaster to control their own media platform and earn more money.</strong></p>
<p id="0a53" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s important to emphasize how much money a podcaster is giving up without dynamic insertion. This is because podcasts are “evergreen content”. Listeners are often seeking out episodes that are 1–10 years old. Listeners who hear these episodes are listening to old ads, which are not paying a podcaster any more.</p>
<p id="9da3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s illustrate with an example.</p>
<p id="6e7a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Below is a row from our Software Engineering Daily management spreadsheet.

When we sell Software Engineering Daily ads that are permanently embedded in the audio file, the advertiser is only judging us based on the performance over the next 6–36 weeks. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">This means that the downloads that we get after 36 weeks are not monetized.</em></p>
<p id="c8ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Over the last 3 months, we have had 206 listens to this episode. At a $25 CPM (lower bound pricing for a podcast with a technical audience), that’s $5 we left on the table. We have roughly 1000 episodes in our back catalog, which means that we could have earned $5000 in additional ad sales if we could have easily sold and dynamically inserted this new ad inventory.</p>
<p id="ffb5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Podcasters with a large back catalog need a way to dynamically change the ad inventory.</strong></p>
<p id="024e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The only available solutions are closed source, expensive products such as <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://megaphone.fm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1553894294544000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://megaphone.fm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1553894294544000">Megaphone</a>. Megaphone hosts the shows for some of the biggest podcasters in the world, including Malcolm Gladwell.</p>

</div>
</figure>
<p id="3990" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The relationship between a podcaster and a closed source hosting and dynamic insertion platform is similar to the relationship between YouTubers and YouTube.</p>
<p id="24e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We are lucky to live in a time when the centralized options such as Megaphone and YouTube allow so many small media platforms to thrive. But we need options that are more portable, and are not overseen by monolithic institutions.</p>
<p id="115f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Podcasters make much more money from dynamic insertion.</p>
<p id="f57d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">To the extent that dynamic insertion technology is centralized, podcasting will be centralized.</strong></p>
<h3 id="f50d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Podsheets Dynamic Insertion</h3>
<p id="71aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">How would dynamic insertion work in Podsheets?</p>
<p id="ea0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s revisit the Software Engineering Daily spreadsheet from earlier, zooming in on a week in March 2018.</p>
<figure id="8858" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p">
<div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked">
<div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill"></div>
<div class="progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded" data-image-id="0*vtYWd9kxFULrIssZ" data-width="961" data-height="199" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="0*vtYWd9kxFULrIssZ" data-scroll="native"><canvas class="progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas" width="75" height="15"></canvas><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*vtYWd9kxFULrIssZ" data-src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*vtYWd9kxFULrIssZ" /></div>
</div>
</figure>
<p id="769c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">As a reminder, these ads are no longer generating any revenue for Software Engineering Daily. But the episodes are still getting listens.</p>
<p id="6b2c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Those ad deals were made in January 2018, and we were paid by the end of March. By the time the month of June started, we were in talks with some of these sponsors to renew their ads, and other sponsors chose not to renew.</p>
<p id="8bcf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now let’s imagine we enter into a negotiation with Audible. Audible wants to buy 2,000 podcast episode listens at a cost of $25 CPM, coming out to a total cost of $50. In an ideal world, we would be able to serve those podcast ads on any episodes that get listens — <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">including old episodes</em>.</p>
<p id="b3eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Editing old episodes requires splicing out the ads in the old audio file and splicing in the new ads to the file. This is a time-consuming process to do in an audio editing tool like Audacity or GarageBand.</p>
<p id="3a25" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For each audio file you would want to edit, you would need to do the following:</p>
<ol class="postList">
<li id="c7e6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Find the start and end timestamp of the old ad you want to replace.</li>
<li id="ce96" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Remove audio from the old ad</li>
<li id="4626" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Compare the length of time of the old ad to the length of time of the new ad. If the new ad is longer, you will need to move the post-ad portion of your podcast audio file to a later start point based on the difference in time between the old and new ad. If the new ad is shorter, you will do the same movement in the opposite direction.</li>
<li id="b8b3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Insert the new ad in the space between the two portions of the podcast audio file.</li>
</ol>
<p id="bf72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Closed-source tools like Megaphone include a script that lets you dynamically insert ads easily. Such a script can be created with <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ffmpeg.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1553894294548000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ffmpeg.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1553894294548000">FFmpeg</a>, an open source tool for editing media files.</p>
<p id="2813" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Podsheets will require a similar script for doing this ad splicing.</p>
<p id="39c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In Podsheets, we should be able to change the ads inserted in a particular episode as simply as changing the entry in our spreadsheet, illustrated below.</p>
<figure id="b780" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p">
<div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked">
<div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill"></div>
<div class="progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded" data-image-id="0*lve0jzojynh0ntQG" data-width="962" data-height="204" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="0*lve0jzojynh0ntQG" data-scroll="native"><canvas class="progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas" width="75" height="15"></canvas><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*lve0jzojynh0ntQG" data-src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*lve0jzojynh0ntQG" /></div>
</div>
</figure>
<p id="dd56" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Under the covers, this change to the spreadsheet interface should trigger our FFmpeg script to run and replace the ads from these podcasts.</p>
<p id="2d18" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In addition, our system should register that these episodes now have an Audible ad. Our stats tracking system should aggregate the new listens that these episodes get, so that we can easily evaluate the number of listens we have received across the Audible campaign.</p>
<p id="db00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One downside of this system is that it requires podcasters to notate the timestamps of the initial ads in their episodes. For podcasters who can afford it, this notation exercise can be outsourced to digital knowledge workers, or to podcast audio editors.</p>
<p id="6f98" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The example of a podcaster easily changing 5 ads is simple but powerful.</p>
<p id="f5c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On top of this spreadsheet-plus-podcast-editing interface, a podcaster could write macros to run their own creative campaigns.</p>
<p id="1415" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li id="6fc3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Serve ads to users in specific geographies based on IP address</li>
<li id="f273" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Serve ads on all episodes about a specific topic</li>
<li id="cf1c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Make all the ad schedules across your entire inventory the same, so that you could quickly run bulk campaigns on short notice</li>
<li id="8abb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Make all your episodes ad-free, or run your own personal calls-to-action when you do not have ad inventory to sell</li>
<li id="0f7f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Dynamically serve super cheap “remnant” advertising when you do not have any other ad inventory to sell</li>
</ul>
<p id="470e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Additionally, such a spreadsheet creates a flexible shared interface. A podcaster could make this spreadsheet public, allowing advertisers to buy ads on episodes in a “self-service” fashion. The Podsheets ecosystem could develop other rich interfaces to allow a podcaster to broadcast their advertising options and explain their process for working with advertisers.</p>
<h3 id="9d0f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Decentralized Advertising</h3>
<p id="99be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">If you are not a podcaster, the ability to dynamically manage your ad inventory may not sound like a killer feature.</p>
<p id="2d91" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Understand that advertising is how podcasters make most of their money. That is not likely to change in the near future. Podcasters need advertisers. Podcasters need technology to manage their advertisements.</p>
<p id="ede1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Why are there so many frictions in podcast advertising? <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Podcast advertising is decentralized.</em></p>
<p id="68d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Podcasters can and should manage their own ad inventory.</p>
<p id="ef2b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The world of podcasts is in a different universe than the rest of the Internet. Podcast advertising has moved us beyond the bureaucracy of advertising agencies, the menacing opacity of corporate advertising duopolies, and the ineffectiveness of one-size-fits-all advertising units.</p>
<p id="f0f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With Podsheets, we can build a tool for empowering podcasters — and paint a picture for how other media formats can decentralize as well.</p>
<h3 id="1ba1" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Future of Media</h3>
<p id="3d1a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Podcasting represents the future of media.</p>
<p id="f0c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Consider the following three aspects of the podcast ecosystem:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li id="eba1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Consumers are extremely happy with the state of podcasting.</strong> There is no shortage of content. Listeners are finding comfort and joy in their podcast listening habits.</li>
<li id="de64" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Content producers have control of their content. </strong>In contrast to Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, it is almost impossible to get de-platformed or de-monetized as a podcaster.</li>
<li id="d02b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Advertisers are seeing excellent results.</strong> Most podcast advertising is highly measurable direct response campaigns with ads read by the host. This format resonates with consumers.</li>
</ul>
<p id="2027" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Every constituent in podcasting is happy. Podcasting’s decentralized nature allows the actors to operate independently. The podcast ecosystem has self-organized into a beautiful, chaotic, positive sum environment.</p>
<p id="3347" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Centralized platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook have enabled all of us to connect with each other. Centralization allows for economies of scale that would not exist in a fragmented, decentralized ecosystem. But that centralization also comes at a cost.</p>
<p id="6876" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We need centralized platforms.</p>
<p id="c502" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We need Twitter to create a town square for us all to connect within. We need Facebook to onboard new Internet users with a system that is more intuitive than the open web. We need Google to unify our intellect.</p>
<p id="585c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But we also need decentralization.</p>
<p id="2436" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Decentralized technologies give us fresh, fertile ground to play with on the Internet. To see this in action, look no further than podcasts. The decentralized model of podcasting will spread across other mediums, notably video and social networking.</p>
<p id="e77f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the long term, Podsheets should allow podcasters to move up the stack, and own their own entire platforms, all built on open source software.</p>
<h3 id="daea" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">A Social Network For Every Podcast</h3>
<p id="cf4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Software Engineering Daily is built on WordPress. We use WordPress to publish our podcast episodes and share basic text and audio information with our listeners.</p>
<p id="0fd3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">WordPress was built as a publishing tool, not a social network. Software Engineering Daily has a community of 30,000 frequent listeners and 150,000+ occasional listeners, and they want to connect with each other. Two years ago, our community started working on an <a href="https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringDaily">open source platform</a> called <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://softwaredaily.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://softwaredaily.com&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1553894294557000">Software Daily</a>.</p>

<h3 id="38ad" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Coming Disaggregation</h3>
<p id="b6d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Open source software has disaggregated the infrastructure layer. But open source does not replace the proprietary layer. It gives users another option. We have Linux <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">in addition to</em> Windows. We have Android <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">in addition to</em> iOS.</p>
<p id="1e73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The same phenomenon is coming to the application layer. We will see open source, easily manageable alternatives to YouTube, Instagram, and Netflix. Text publishing has already been disaggregated by WordPress. Audio publishing has been disaggregated by podcasts.</p>
<p id="0da6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With Podsheets, we hope to give podcasters an alternative to the centralized networks. But it is an adjunct alternative, not a complete replacement. A podcaster does not need to opt out of the centralized ecosystem completely to use Podsheets.</p>
<p id="5d10" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As the cost of computing and storage drops to zero, the media landscape will change in favor of the creators. Raw resources will not be scarce, but creativity and entrepreneurship will always be scarce.</p>
<p id="4fc1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Video has not been disaggregated yet, possibly due to the size of video files. Social networks have not<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> </em>been disaggregated yet, perhaps because of the importance of strong recommendation systems, search algorithms, and other complexities that are required to make a decent social network.</p>
<p id="793f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Eventually, video creators and social media influencers will want tools to build and manage their own platforms. In the limit, every media company becomes a social media company. And every social media company wants its own platform.</p>
<p id="812c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The golden age of decentralized media starts with podcasting. Let’s hope it never ends.</p>

<p><a href="https://findcollabs.com/hackathon"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FindCollabs $5000 Hackathon Ends Saturday April 15th, 2019</span></a></p>
<p><a href="http://softwaredaily.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ne</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">w version of Software Daily, our app and ad-free subscription service</span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://findcollabs.com/project/TQQCLSL2KYLq9jS7gxBq"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software Daily is looking for help with Android engineering, QA, machine learning, and more</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haseeb Qureshi is an entrepreneur and investor. As a teenager, Haseeb played poker professionally through the online poker bubble. His path from poker to software entrepreneurship has been explored in previous episodes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2007, Haseeb and I met at an online poker table. As we battled each other for thousands of dollars, Haseeb and I realized we shared an affinity for obnoxious screen names, obnoxious online avatars, and the city of Austin, Texas. We were both living in the city, and met each other in the real world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our earliest days, Haseeb and I were not friends. It was a strange time&#8211;we were disembodied minds, drifting on the Internet, attached mostly to the fluctuating balances of our Full Tilt Poker and Pokerstars accounts. This was not a time for friendship&#8211;it was a time for ruthless, modern competition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the history of poker, alliances have always been fickle. And online, backstabbing and deception was an art that had been barely explored. Any true friendship was a missed opportunity to exploit a competitor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The duplicity of the online poker world knew no limits, and our sheltered, posh existence of teenagers with great parents, food on the table every evening, and no reason to worry became shattered by the daily tumult of complete financial instability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online poker was in a bubble. In the early days of a bubble, success comes easy. You have to be a fool to fail. When a bubble pops, the ocean washes back to the sea, and we see who is left without any clothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The poker bust wiped me out. Not just financially, but emotionally. In a month, I lost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and I lost my identity. After doing nothing but playing poker for years, what was I left with? What durable skills had I developed? What friends did I have to turn to? What was my ideology? What was my vision for my own future?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I plummeted into despair, Haseeb rose like a meteor through the world of heads up poker, thriving on the rise in popularity of pot limit Omaha, a game whose theoretical complexity suited Haseeb better than the rudimentary game of no limit hold’em. The bigger the stacks, the bigger the decision trees, and the bigger the decision trees, the more edge Haseeb had over his opponents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a professional poker player, regardless of whether you succeed or fail, the banality of what you are actually doing eventually catches up to you. The best players are able to put an athletic framing to the game. Yes, you are competing on a zero sum basis, with a 52 card deck that was invented last century. Yes, your innovation is measured in the smallest increment of invention. But in some ways, that is the beauty of the game. We don’t need a revolution in the game of basketball, because to appreciate the dynamic of basketball is to appreciate the dynamic of humans. And the same can be said of poker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, the successful online poker player </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">must</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> eventually have their own reality shattered. Because to be a successful poker player, you must be rigorous and critical. You will eventually be forced to step back and say: “what </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">this thing I’m doing every day? How have I become hooked to a screen? I don’t know how that screen works. What are these numbers? Are they fabricated? How do they control my emotions so thoroughly? Who is running this thing?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haseeb grew tired of poker. He wrote a book about the game to memorialize his thoughts, then abandoned it. He studied philosophy and literature, searching for something new in the historical musings of humanity. He traveled Europe, working as a farmer to reconnect with the physical world. He discovered the Effective Altruism movement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding no solace in his poker spoils, Haseeb gave away most of his money and started from scratch. As he rebuilt himself, he found software engineering and charted a path to San Francisco, where we reconnected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this episode, Haseeb joins me for a discussion of software, philosophy, poker, and the nature of bubbles. Indeed, Haseeb and I have now lived through four major bubbles: dot coms, poker, the 2008 financial crisis, and the crypto bubble. Throughout these bubbles, the mediums change but never does the message: human beings are deeply irrational, tribalistic, and emotional.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://findcollabs.com/project/TQQCLSL2KYLq9jS7gxBq"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Software Daily is looking for help with Android engineering, QA, machine learning, and more</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consul is a tool from HashiCorp that allows users to store and retrieve information from a highly available key/value data store. Consul is used for storage of critical cluster information, such as service IP locations and configuration data. A service interacts with Consul via a daemon process on the node of that service. The daemon process periodically shares information with the Consul server over a gossip UDP protocol and can share data on a more immediate basis using TCP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consul’s functionality has increased recently to add secure service connectivity. Consul Connect allows services to establish mutual TLS encryption with each other. The addition of mutual TLS to the Consul feature set is closely incidental with Consul gaining a title of “service mesh.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Service mesh is an increasingly popular pattern that can encompass a variety of features: load balancing, security policy management, service discovery, and routing. Tools which offer self-described “service mesh” functionality include Linkerd, Kong, AWS App Mesh, Solo.io Gloo, and Google’s Istio open source project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul Banks is the engineering lead of Consul at HashiCorp. He joins the show to talk about the service mesh category and the past, present, and future of Consul.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data sets can be modeled in a row-wise, relational format. When two data sets share a common field, those data sets can be combined in a procedure called a join. A join combines the data of two data sets into one data set that is often bigger than the initial two data sets independently occupied. In fact, this new data set is often so much bigger that it creates problems for the machine learning engineers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arun Kumar is an assistant professor at UC San Diego. He joins the show to discuss the modern lifecycle of machine learning models, and the gaps in the tooling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arun’s research into improving processing of joined data sets has been adopted by companies such as Google. Some of that research has been adapted into open source machine learning tools that improve the performance of machine learning jobs with minimal code required.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distributed stream processing allows developers to build applications on top of large sets of data that are being rapidly created. Stream processing is often described as an alternative to batch processing. In batch processing, a single large computation is performed over a large, static data set. In stream processing, a computation is performed repeatedly and continuously over a data set that is being appended to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A stream is often stored in a distributed queue such as Kafka, Kinesis, Pulsar, or Google PubSub. A stream is often processed with a stream processing tool such as Spark, Flink, Storm, or Google Cloud Dataflow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holden Karau is an engineer who works on open source projects at Google. She returns to the show to describe the state of stream processing and discuss modern best practices.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A software application requires compute and storage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both compute and storage have been abstracted into cloud tools that can be used by developers to build highly available distributed systems. In our previous episode, we explored the compute side. In today’s episode we discuss storage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Application developers store data in a variety of abstractions. In-memory caches allow for fast lookups. Relational databases allow for efficient retrieval of well-structured tables. NoSQL databases allow for retrieval of documents that may have a less defined schema. File storage systems allow the access pattern of nested file systems, like on your laptop. Distributed object storage systems allow for highly durable storage of any data type.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon S3 is a distributed object storage system with a wide spectrum of use cases. S3 is used for media file storage, archiving of log files, and data lake applications. S3 functionality has increased over the years, developing different tiers of data retrieval latency and cost structure. AWS S3 Glacier allows for long-term storage of data at a large cost reduction, in exchange for increased latency of data access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kevin Miller is the general manager of Amazon Glacier at Amazon Web Services. He joins the show to talk about the history of storage, the different options for storage in the cloud, and the design of S3 Glacier.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/hackathon"><em>FindCollabs Hackathon at App Academy on April 6, 2019</em></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Amazon Web Services, there are many ways to run an application on a single node.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first compute option on AWS was the EC2 virtual server instance. But EC2 is a large abstraction compared to what many people need for their nodes&#8211;which is a container with a smaller set of resources to work with. Containers can be run within a managed cluster like ECS or EKS, or run on their own as AWS Fargate instances, or simply as Docker containers running without a container orchestration tool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the option of explicit container instances, users can run their application as a “serverless” function-as-a-service such as AWS Lambda. Functions-as-a-service abstract away the container and let the developer operate at a higher level, while also providing some cost savings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers use these different compute options for different reasons. Deepak Singh is the director of compute services at Amazon Web Services, and he joins the show to discuss the use cases and tradeoffs of these options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deepak also discusses how these tools are useful internally to AWS. ECS and Lambda are high-level APIs that are used to build even higher level services such as AWS Batch, which is a service for performing batch processing over large data sets.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ben Lorica is the chief data scientist at O’Reilly Media and the program director of the Strata Data Conference. In his work, Ben spends time with people across the software industry, giving him broad perspective. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the early days of the data engineering ecosystem, the Hadoop vendor wars were starting between Cloudera and Hortonworks. Strata was a neutral ground for practitioners and open source contributors to meet and share ideas about the Hadoop ecosystem. Since then, the conference has grown to encompass topics such as data science, distributed databases, streaming frameworks, and machine learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many open questions in the data world right now. What is the best path that an enterprise can take to build out a data platform? How should a software team be arranged to efficiently build machine learning models? Which distributed streaming frameworks should I use for what purpose?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ben joins the show to discuss modern data engineering, data science, and infrastructure.</span></p>

<p><em>Upcoming events: </em></p>
<p><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/meetup"><em>A Conversation with Haseeb Qureshi at Cloudflare on April 3, 2019</em></a></p>
<p><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/hackathon"><em>FindCollabs Hackathon at App Academy on April 6, 2019</em></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A currency can fulfill numerous financial use cases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One use case is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">store of value</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: currency holders can reliably expect their currency to maintain some value, though that value may fluctuate over time. Another use case is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">speculation</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: currency holders are owning currency in the hope that the market price of the currency will increase over time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin is a useful </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">store of value</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and an instrument for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">speculation</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, Bitcoin still does not fulfill the financial use case that most people need from a currency: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">price stability</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The price of Bitcoin fluctuates rapidly, making it difficult to use Bitcoin for small purchases such as coffee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine you want to buy a cup of coffee with Bitcoin. The coffee shop owner needs to offer the option to sell you that cup of coffee using Bitcoin as the medium of exchange. This owner must denominate the price of that coffee as some number of Bitcoin. Since the price of Bitcoin fluctuates so rapidly, the coffee shop owner needs to adjust the price of that cup of coffee constantly in order to make sure that the coffee is cheap enough for the consumer to want to buy it, but expensive enough to make a profit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is hard to assign prices to market goods in terms of Bitcoin because the currency is in constant flux. Even though many of us would like to use Bitcoin in our everyday lives, most marketplaces are denominated in US dollars or other currencies because a marketplace needs a stable currency in order to operate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rune Christensen is the CEO of MakerDAO, a system that provides a price-stable cryptocurrency. MakerDAO is an elegant set of currencies, collateralized debt, smart contracts, and other incentive tools that result in the creation of several transparent, decentralized financial instruments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rune joins the show to talk about the importance of stablecoins and how MakerDAO has engineered a decentralized currency that has maintained stability even through tumultuous market conditions.</span></p>

<p><em>Upcoming events: </em></p>
<p><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/meetup"><em>A Conversation with Haseeb Qureshi at Cloudflare on April 3, 2019</em></a></p>
<p><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/hackathon"><em>FindCollabs Hackathon at App Academy on April 6, 2019</em></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Yeh is an entrepreneur, investor, and author. He co-wrote </span><em><a href="https://www.blitzscaling.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blitzscaling</span></a></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blitzscaling is a strategy for growing a company that has found product market fit. Blitzscaling prioritizes speed over efficiency, arguing that fast growth is necessary to achieve “first scaler advantage.” When a company is the first to scale successfully within a large market, that company gains access to a wealth of market opportunities that are not available to companies which are not at scale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples of successful Blitzscalers include Airbnb, LinkedIn, Amazon, and Facebook. In the hypergrowth phases of these companies, there were deliberate strategic tradeoffs that caused the company to suffer in the short term in exchange for the chance at market dominance in the long term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blitzscaling is a broad strategic concept which manifests differently in different companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Airbnb was in its early stages of growth in 2011, the company was faced with the existential threat of a European competitor called Wimdu. Wimdu offered to sell to Airbnb, but this would have required the merger of two companies with distinctly different cultures. Instead, Airbnb chose to raise more money and rapidly expand into Europe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, Google’s rapid path to becoming a dominant information service involved acquisitions that we now see as key Google products, including Android, Google Maps, and Google Earth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through numerous examples in recent business history, Blitzscaling explores the fundamental tradeoff between speed and efficiency, usually biasing speed as the preferable element. But Blitzscaling does not work for every company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the food delivery sector, many companies who tried to blitzscale ended up going out of business because they had lowered their prices too much in order to try to earn customer loyalty. By lowering their prices too much, food delivery startups built businesses with fundamentally bad unit economics and a fickle customer base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other cases, aggressive blitzscaling can work for a short period of time, but can cause a company’s culture to suffer in ways that are very hard to repair. Blitzscaling can also cause problems in a core software product. Growing too quickly can cause a product to have a bloated user interface. If the backend infrastructure layer expands too quickly, sensitive data could be left exposed due to a lack of proper software security policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Yeh joins the show to talk about the strategy of Blitzscaling and his wide-ranging career. Chris studied creative writing and product design at Stanford before joining DE Shaw, the famous quantitative hedge fund. Later, he became an investor and worked in several leadership roles in software companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His wide range of experiences make Chris an excellent author and conversationalist. We explored the ideas of both Blitzscaling and his previous book </span><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Alliance-Managing-Talent-Networked-Age/dp/1625275773"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Alliance</span></a></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which lays out a modern vision for the dynamic between employers and employees. We also talked about investing, Dungeons and Dragons, and podcasting.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/hackathon"><em>FindCollabs Hackathon at App Academy on April 6, 2019</em></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber’s infrastructure supports millions of riders and billions of dollars in transactions. Uber has high throughput and high availability requirements, because users depend on the service for their day-to-day transportation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Uber was going through hypergrowth in 2015, the number of services was growing rapidly, as was the load across those services. Using a cloud provider was a risky option, because the costs could potentially grow out of control. Uber made a decision early on to invest in physical hardware in order to keep costs at a reasonable level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last 3 years, Uber’s infrastructure has stabilized. The platform engineering team has built systems for monitoring, deployment, and service proxying. Developing and maintaining microservices within Uber has become easier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prashant Varanasi and Akshay Shah are engineers who have been with Uber for more than three years. They work on Uber’s platform engineering team, and their current focus is on the service proxy layer, a sidecar that runs alongside Uber services providing features such as load balancing, service discovery, and rate limiting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prashant and Akshay join the show to talk about Uber infrastructure, microservices, and the architecture of a service proxy. We also talk in detail about the benefits of using Go for critical systems infrastructure, and some techniques for profiling and debugging in Go.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google has been building large-scale scheduling systems for more than fifteen years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Borg was started around 2003, giving engineers at Google a unified platform to issue long-lived service workloads as well as short-lived batch workloads onto a pool of servers. Since the early days of Borg, the scheduler systems built by Google have matured through several iterations. Omega was an effort to improve the internal Borg system, and Kubernetes is an open source container orchestrator built with the learnings of Borg and Omega.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A scheduling system needs to be able to accept a wide variety of workload types and find compute resources within a cluster to schedule those workloads onto. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a wide variety of potential workloads that could be scheduled&#8211;batch jobs, stateful services, stateless services, and daemon services. Different workloads can have different priority levels. A high priority workload should be able to find compute resources quickly, and a low priority workload can wait longer to find resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian Grant is a principal engineer at Google. He joins the show to talk about his experience building workload schedulers and designing APIs for engineers to interface with those schedulers.    </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last decade, some of the largest new technology companies have built their own systems that fulfill the roles of cluster management and resource scheduling. </span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/10/12/netflix-scheduling-with-sharma-podila/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Netflix</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Twitter, and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_WuUgTqgOc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have all spoken about their internal projects to make distributed systems resource allocation more economical. These companies find themselves continually reinventing scheduling and orchestration, with inspiration from Google Borg and their own internal experiences running large numbers of containers and virtual machines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber’s engineering team has built a cluster scheduler called Peloton. Peloton is based on Apache Mesos, and is architected to handle a wide range of workloads: data science jobs like Hadoop MapReduce; long running services such as a ridesharing marketplace service; monitoring daemons such as </span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2019/02/12/ubers-monitoring-platform-with-rob-skillington/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber’s M3 collector</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; and database services such as MySQL.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Min Cai and Mayank Bansal are engineers at Uber who work on Peloton. When they set out to create Peloton, they looked at the existing schedulers in the ecosystem, including</span><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/04/19/googles-container-management-brendan-burns/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kubernetes, Mesos, Hadoop’s YARN system, and Borg itself</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Min and Mayank join the show today to give a brief history of distributed systems schedulers and discuss their work on Peloton. They have been working in the world of distributed systems schedulers for many years&#8211;including experiences building core Hadoop infrastructure and virtual machine schedulers at VMware.</span></p>

<p><em>Upcoming events: </em></p>
<p><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/meetup"><em>A Conversation with Haseeb Qureshi at Cloudflare on April 3, 2019</em></a></p>
<p><a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/hackathon"><em>FindCollabs Hackathon at App Academy on April 6, 2019</em></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Log management requires the processing and indexing of high volumes of semi-structured data. A log management service takes log data and puts it in a cloud-hosted application so that application operators can access those logs to troubleshoot issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large tech company will produce terabytes of logs. Those logs are produced on the host where a service is running. A logging agent on that host will transfer the logs to the log management service in the cloud. Once the logs are in the cloud, they are parsed, indexed, and stored in a way that is easy to query.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2014, Renaud Boutet co-founded Logmatic, a log management service that eventually became a leading provider. Logmatic was acquired by Datadog, and Renaud now works as a vice president at Datadog. In today’s episode, Renaud joins the show to talk about the architecture of a log management service. We talk about storage tiers, scalability requirements, failover strategies, and logging for serverless functions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steve Herrod was the CTO at VMware and now works as a managing director at General Catalyst, where he focuses on investments relating to security.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Large enterprises are difficult to secure. An enterprise has sprawling infrastructure, with both on-prem and cloud infrastructure. Identity management systems, vulnerability scanning, secure network infrastructure, and policy management tools are just a few example areas where enterprises spend billions of dollars on security software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Threats often make their way into an enterprise by way of social engineering. This can result in phishing attacks, corporate espionage, and ransomware. Protecting against social engineering is very difficult, as there are so many channels to communicate through&#8211;Facebook Messenger, Linkedin, email, and ad networks can all be used to perform social engineering attacks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enterprise security software is a very different business from other types of software companies. Unlike developer tools or cloud infrastructure, security software is usually not self-serve. Security solutions usually require a longer sales and integration process with a customer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steve Herrod joins the show to talk about the enterprise security world, the go-to-market strategy for successful security companies, and his perspective on what makes for a viable venture capital investment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coding in the browser has been attempted several times in the last decade. Building a development environment in the browser has numerous technical challenges. How does the code execute safely? How do you fit all of the requirements of a development environment into a browser window? How do you get users to switch from their normal IDE (interactive development environment)?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CodeSandbox is an online code editor created by Ives van Hoorne and Bas Buursma. CodeSandbox allows users to program and run applications in the browser. It is a full developer platform that allows users the ability to install npm modules, run their code, and share their applications with other users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The engineering problems within CodeSandbox are not easy&#8211;building a web-based IDE is complicated. But CodeSandbox is also an exciting project because it lowers the barrier to entry for many newer programmers. The development experience for a new programmer is still a difficult onramp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are an experienced developer, you have a workflow that you are comfortable with. It might involve vim, or emacs, or JetBrains IDEs, or Eclipse. But newer developers can find these environments confusing and hard to get started with. The development environments of today are integrated with build tools, Github repositories, and deployment platforms. This can be overwhelming for a newer developer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CodeSandbox is a very visual tool, which makes it especially useful for new developers who learn through seeing examples running live in the browser. CodeSandbox is also used by web developers who want a modern, shareable form of developing software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ives and Bas join the show to talk about the motivation for CodeSandbox and the engineering challenges they have solved.</span></p>
